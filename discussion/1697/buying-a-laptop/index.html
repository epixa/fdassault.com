						Just finished bootcamp.  I&#39;m now down in Pensacola, FL.  I&#39;ll tell you guys more about it after I have my own laptop and internet connection.  I&#39;ve got a 30 min limit here.  <br /><br />I need links/suggestions for a laptop around &#36;750.  I&#39;m looking for value and reliability.  Gaming isn&#39;t a priority for me anymore, though I will definitely still be doing it.  Any help is welcome.  I&#39;ll be back tomorrow to check this so help fast&#33;  I&#39;d like to buy it this week.  Worse comes to worse, I may have to just stop in at Best Buy and pick one up there.  But can&#39;t I find better deals online?<br /><br />Thanks guys&#33;		</div>

I doubt they are let you live off base if you aren&#39;t married (I feel like you would have told us that, but guys have done stranger things.)<br /><br />You can find better deals on a lot of the stuff at the NEX at Correy compared to Best Buy.

						Fuck yeah.  Can&#39;t wait to hear about it.<br /><br />Try Dell.  I&#39;ve never had problems, though I hear other people are less enthusiastic.  I&#39;ve found they are usually at a pretty good price point. And if you&#39;re into unix, I think they&#39;ll load ubunto on that shit.<br /><br />&#36;0.02		</div>

You couldn&#39;t match those new ones in time, so you &quot;enlisted with your backup rate of AV&quot; (no clue.  sorry man.)

You couldn&#39;t match those new ones in time, so you &quot;enlisted with your backup rate of AV&quot; (no clue.  sorry man.)  But from the next sentence I can presume that this means that you&#39;re in some kind of military purgatory and you have until you get to your first duty station to be able to go SEAL?<br /><br />Sry am dum.</div><br /><br />It means I&#39;m enlisted as a normal sailor, instead of joining the special warfare community.  AV is my job.  Avionics.  Aviation electronics and computer systems.  Once I get to my first duty station as a normal sailor, I will then be able to resume my journey towards becoming a SEAL.<br /><br />I made a decision on a laptop.  I went with the Sony Vaio VGN-FW510F/B.  The selling point was the resolution (1600x900) which is hard to find at that price point (&#36;700).  Found it at Best Buy for &#36;650 but it was sold out so I went online and spent a little more.  It&#39;s a tremendous value.  I never would have considered a Sony laptop before but they all seem to get great reviews and the little bit of playing with it I did in-store sold me on it.<br /><br />Anyone have any good/bad experience with Sony laptops?  Not like it matters now, but I&#39;m curious.		</div>

Military speak is like a foreign language man...<br /><br />Not a personal experience, but Conrad, you remember Conrad, has been freelancing computer support shit, and his experience has been lackluster support on the part of Sony.  This is understandable given the scope of their business... they probably can&#39;t support their TV&#39;s or their PS3&#39;s very well either.  But you&#39;re not an idiot, so I imagine Sony&#39;s support line won&#39;t be getting many calls from you.  Otherwise, the problems he&#39;s seen with them have been, as usual, PEBKAC		</div>

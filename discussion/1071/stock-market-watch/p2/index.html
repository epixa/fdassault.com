What will happen over the next 6 to 12 months is deflation. This is when you will see house prices fall to true prices and gas may cheapen; however right around the corner is our giant liquidity trap: the housing market. When interest rates are low or zero, the lending of money is made easier and people are able to buy houses, cars, and groceries. When a recession hits and the interest rates are at 0 and the market is FLOODED with assets (businesses, houses, cars, boats, ect...) but noone is lending money, the FED is going to start increasing the money supply. The increase in the money supply is called inflation. This money has gone directly to financial institutions for lending, though no significant lending has occurred. Because these banks have held onto the money they&#39;ve created a much larger supply which weakens the dollar long term. As the pile of money grows, but is not used and repaid, it begins to lose value. When this occurs we will see hyperinflation. <br /><br />To your second paragraph, We didn&#39;t drag anyone down with us. China will be fine, Russia will be fine, New Zealand will be fine, and they are not as dependent on the US system as we&#39;d like to believe. This is a problem of the United States&#39; people for the United States&#39; people. We&#39;ve got some international interests wrapped up in our shit but it&#39;s our pile.		</div>

						So what&#39;s everyone&#39;s take on the market now?<br /><br />Recently we&#39;ve had a steady week of closing around 9,500.... is there a large correction in store from all the upward movement? or were the few days of downward and the past week of steadiness after most Q2 earnings that correction? <br /><br />Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have both moved from around .60 a share to over &#36;2.00 a share after FRE posted a Q2 &quot;profit&quot;.  AIG had a reverse split, trended down for a bit to around &#36;13, and has shot up to &#36;50.  Citibank has gone from around &#36;2.00 to over &#36;5.00, and it seems there is strong resistance keeping it above &#36;5.00 now with a higher target price.  The &quot;bad companies&quot; that have been held down are rallying, will that hold up?  So many questions so many theories :-P.  <br /><br />Still have many retailers that posted substantial losses in the second quarter but are &quot;optimistic about the 3rd quarter due to the economy turning around.&quot;  I am starting to think some of this is reality, but I have not seen much in the way of prevention for this again.  I mean cmon, things have been on an upward trend for decades and then we have our current depression that we&#39;re supposedly on the way up and out of again after only 1-2 years?  <br /><br />Consumers have to spend money to get things going again, and arguably businesses have to fail or cutback for reduced spending.  Has this actually happened? I haven&#39;t seen much capitalism saving our asses here.<br /><br />Let&#39;s get some opinions.		</div>

Specifically the TVA, and other major Hydroelectric/Irrigation projects undertaken during that time. Hard to have fully functional plants if you don&#39;t have a power grid capable of supporting them. Likewise on the agriculture projects.<br /><br />Post WW2 then had Eisenhower and the Interstate Highway System which was actually justified as a national defense initiative, that gave further traction to a lot of work done by the New Deal.<br /><br />I&#39;d be dubious on saying the New Deal itself pulled the US out of its economic slump any faster than it would have if no intervention had been made by the government, and generally agree with some of the arguments that it may have slightly prolonged it. However, the long term outcome was that it set the stage for comparatively explosive growth over the decades that followed.<br /><br />So basically you&#39;re arguing short-term versus long-term. Up to a point, New Deal type policies work very well on the long-term side(decades). On the short term end of the scale, those policies seem to be lacking as they don&#39;t really create economic growth themselves, they simply create the avenues by which future growth may occur(once the economy recovers on its own). <br /><br />&quot;Up to a point&quot; is also a major factor, as the level of success to be found with those kinds of policies is going to be largely contingent on the status/quality of the national infrastructure/other services going into it. If they&#39;re in poor/overused condition, dumping lots of money into it can pay huge dividends in years to come... However, if you follow the path of Japan for example... If the things you are improving upon are in a good condition in the first place, the results you obtain are going to be pretty lackluster, it&#39;ll create jobs while the work takes place, but once the work is done those jobs will be gone and nothing else of significance will follow suit for a long time(such as building bridges to nowhere).<br /><br />Of course, the other problem with looking at things like the stimulus bill congress passed at the start of this year and its effectiveness is that the spending part(rather than the obligating funds part) for all of that money doesn&#39;t really start to kick into gear until next year... Just in time for the elections.<br /><br />Wouldn&#39;t it be great if they could get another second stimulus bill passed because the first one hasn&#39;t done much... And use it to immediately fund(it is an election year next year after all) all those projects that are now much closer to &quot;shovel ready&quot; thanks to everyone making a run for funding from the first round? (I&#39;m specifically looking at the TIGER projects that communities had to submit proposals for by the 15th of September -- I know in my area it resulted in local planning agencies going for funding a project that was initially planned for ~2020 as that was when they expected the need to be so bad they&#39;d be able to justify and fund it, I&#39;m sure they&#39;re not that unique in this)<br /><br />Going to be interesting to see what comes in the world of government funded projects this next year.		</div>

						<br />Being one of the only industrialized countries left after WWII surely helped.  Starting after WWII anyway.

It wouldn&#39;t be great if they got another stimulus bill passed, since much of the money from the first still hasn&#39;t been spent yet.<br /><br />New Deal Policies are only partially about actually improving our infrastructure and setting the stage for the *next big thing*.  Which in the case of TND was likely the boon of manufacturing that flourished post WWII.  We had just gone apeshit after the Industrial Revolution and had no idea how to handle ourselves economically with the level of growth we were experiencing and subsequently got burned over it.  But we had the technology still, and the demand was still there (even if the money wasn&#39;t) and then we built up our capabilities right before all our competitors were blown away.  Sure, I can buy that.  So we should posture ourselves for the next big thing now and be sure that there isn&#39;t sufficient competition in that market.<br /><br />Meanwhile, that is just a pipe dream, and we lucked out post-WWII.  What the new deal, and this stimulus bill, are really about is putting people back to work.  If they can work on things that benefit the country as a whole, then that&#39;s awesome.  But having people taxably employed is pretty awesome on it&#39;s own.<br />		</div>

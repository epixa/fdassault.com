						First off, insult me more why don&#39;t you. You may have a decent theoretical understanding of how the market works, but you have ZERO experience. You have ZERO knowledge of what us &#39;greedy wall-streeters&#39; think. And guess what? Us here on wall street, for the most part, control the market. Argue what you want, your econ 101 teacher probably alluded to that when you discussed the difference between short selling and selling a stock.<br /><br />The market was relatively flat before the election. For two reasons, people wanted to see what was going to happen come 11/4 and that the influx of money (gov&#39;t) started hitting wall street and financial companies in need.<br /><br />Let me tell you, a bunch of new hedge funds are down this year, but up from previous years. And personal investors? They&#39;re not new to this game, either. Most people are still UP from 10 years ago. Why do you think SAC and GL withdrew their monies and closed their books earlier in the year? Because they all wanted to play golf? People here understand the correlation between risk and reward, and maybe you should learn that sometimes you have to cut your losses.<br /><br />You&#39;re such an inept &#39;investor&#39; that it&#39;s incredibly hard to explain something to you. Pick up freakonomics and think you know more than those who are employed in the sector? Do I claim that since I have grilled once or twice that I&#39;m a better chef than Charlie Palmer?<br /><br />The market IS simple to understand, and what we are witnessing is something called &#39;pricing&#39; -- where people try to predict the future and weigh it into their current investments.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aj_ayFUP0riQ&amp;refer=worldwide" target="_blank">These</a> are NOT <a rel="nofollow" href="http://in.reuters.com/article/usMktRpt/idINN0531971420081105" target="_blank">coincidences</a>.<br /><br /><br />		</div>

						<a rel="nofollow" href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/11/06/news/economy/Oct_retailsales/index.htm?postversion=2008110612" target="_blank">It certainly couldn&#39;t have been that the worst month of sales in 8 years happened in October could it</a>?  Nope.  It was Obama.  I don&#39;t follow this crap this closely so I didn&#39;t have this info handy, but it took about 30 seconds of searching to find a... you know... good reason... based loosely on what I like to call &quot;reality&quot;.<br /><br />I&#39;d also like to add that anybody who is selling now because of the increase in capital gains taxes on the 20th are doing the following:<br />Losing money now so they don&#39;t have to worry about potentially losing money later.  I&#39;d call that pretty short sighted.  What if the market improves in two years, then their stocks would be UP and they&#39;d actually have a capital gain to tax.  Right now they are just straight up losing money.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what&#39;s happening.<br /><br />/rant edit:<br />you know.  This is only making me more and more annoyed as the day wears on.  Why the FUCK would people sell at a loss now to avoid taxes in the future?  That&#39;s just stupid.  Let&#39;s look at the process Obama has to follow to increase capital gains taxes in the first place.  He has to draft legislation, put it in front of the legislative branch (that isn&#39;t filibuster proof), and get it passed through two houses of corporately bought out and corrupt politicians, then he has to sign it.  This doesn&#39;t magically become law on 1/20/09 man.  And why sell now and not wait until December to see if the market gets better if you&#39;re already taking on losses NOW?  If you wanna talk about president&#39;s effects on the market look at the 90&#39;s.  Guess who was in charge then.  And besides, Bush&#39;s capital gains tax cuts wear off in 55 days.  Before Obama takes office.  Where was the reaction to THAT piece of news if everybody on wallstreet is shitting their pants over higher taxes?<br /><br />Blaming 8 years of failed economic policies on the guy who hasn&#39;t even been inaugurated yet?  Totally logical.		</div>

						Mostly I don&#39;t intervene on this sort of stuff because everyone has different perspectives. But Andrew has a point here. Take out all the semantics of the argument and look at it in terms of logic. If you believe that one event correlates to another on the basis of concurrence, then all other events should correlate with the same relationship on the basis of concurrence. You have provided no evidence otherwise, so your logic is false, which makes you look like an ass when you start babbling about how your logic is better than his based on personal knowledge. Logic is backed by knowledge, but from your standpoint it seems like knowledge is backed logic. Awful.<br /><br />And just because I believe you started this thread in spite of the election results, let me tell you something. I think most of your so claimed &quot;wall-streeters&quot; are retarded and a hindrance to this countries&#39; economy by making more bad decisions than good ones, including you. If any particular person or group of people actually caused today&#39;s market drop, it is you, not Obama. Stop shifting blames. I think you should wait until Obama has a reasonable amount of time in the office to make changes before you say anything else. How can you judge someone&#39;s presidency without actually seeing his presidency? That&#39;s what I call judging a book by its cover. For all we know, he could turn out to be just like Bush or like Wilson.		</div>

						Here is the main point of my statement.  Republican&#39;s i know are going to scrutinize every single misstep Obama makes.  They want to essentially turn him into as much of a screw up as Bush (Not possible in my opinion).  If it&#39;s not the economy then it will be something else.		</div>

						Jeeeez.<br /><br />I think it would be fair to say that you are both right.<br /><br />The market probably did drop because of Obama&#39;s election, and the market probably did drop because of other reasons as well.   <br /><br />Obama&#39;s policies are not great for the market so it would make sense for the market to drop once he was elected.  People react to a lot of things, often small, so I think dismissing the election results(One of the most important and biggest events of the last few years) as not having any significant impact on the market would be a bit naive.<br /><br />Also, there is no need to make these discussions personal.<br /><br />(And I do see the market going below 7500 again, not sure how fast though)		</div>

What news do they read?  Apparently they read things that say the sky will fall when capital gains taxes go up.  No need to understand Obama&#39;s plan, or wait to see if he even has the support of the congress (who are bought out D &amp; R both), or even to look at history and see that they were making more money that was worth more when CGT&#39;s were at Reagan or Clinton levels.  Nope.  I&#39;m just going to ignore all perspective and history and logic and go straight to being scurred of the darky and his scurry policies.<br /><br />If these people are that stupid then we SHOULD take all their money away and give it to poor people.  They don&#39;t deserve it.  I don&#39;t think they are that stupid, so the only explanation left is that they are just trying to shift blame to the democrats, which has been the strategy of republicans and their kin for decades.  It&#39;s occam&#39;s razor, mang.<br /><br />There are PLENTY of reasons that could be given for a downturn.  Those stories don&#39;t play as well as ZOMGOBAMA, especially in the crowd that&#39;s reading that news.  So we don&#39;t hear about the terrible sales in October completely changing companies &#39;09 forcasts.  You don&#39;t hear that a couple dozen companies had to renegotiate shit with the FCC to stay afloat.<br /><br />A couple years ago (I forget a lot of the specifics) a magazine like forbes or something published a story about bad sales for a company.  That company proceeded to go bankrupt.  They had actually had record high sales that year.  The media has more power to manipulate the markets than the investors when the investors let themselves be manipulated.<br /><br />I ask again.  Why are Obama&#39;s policies not good for the market?		</div>

						To be honest Andrew, I think you immediately took this thread out of context, and I don&#39;t think you&#39;re really arguing against Mungo&#39;s legitimate point so much as defending Obama from an attack that wasn&#39;t made.<br /><br />Maybe Mungo does think Obama&#39;s economic policies are the suck, but he didn&#39;t say that here.  He said, as the only person on these forums that has the experience to do so, that wall street was unhappy that Obama was elected, and their reaction to the results led to plummeting stocks.  Whether wall street&#39;s concerns are legitimate are irrelevant in the context of this thread.<br /><br />The fact is, wall street will always choose deregulation over regulation.  They will always choose corporate tax cuts.  They will always support the candidate that wants to do as little as possible to get in their way.  So it isn&#39;t ridiculous at all to assume that they did not support Obama, and were unhappy when he was elected.  I guarantee you that everyone on wall street is confident that the market would right itself if Washington would just get off their backs, and Obama clearly has no intention of doing that.		</div>

						Fair enough, but the point is broader than that.  Not only do I not believe that Obama&#39;s policies will be bad for wall street.  I also think that nobody on wallstreet worth a damn is stupid enough to take as staggering a loss as they&#39;d have to to avoid a potential tax increase.  That&#39;s just plain dumb.<br /><br />The point being made is basically:<br />The lack of regulation in the financial markets has lead to a golden age of investment, where stocks go up so far so fast that everyone in the market is a millionaire. It is quite reasonable that investors would be afraid to see all this come to an end.		</div>

						I reread your posts Drew, and I misinterpreted your intentions. I apologize for my retaliation. However, I still believe that wall street are heading the wrong direction, as they have often. I do believe however that it won&#39;t ever go below 8000 before his presidency, and pending his presidency, it could then go either way from there. Like you said, it could go below 7500, but I think not until his presidency has had some time. But it could also skyrocket back to 10,000+.		</div>

And that the president&#39;s policies have a direct correlation with market falls, but rallies are independent from the government completely.

						Don&#39;t be nearsighted. You can&#39;t deny that on Nov 6, the reaction was because of his election. Whether or not that was justified is another story -- one that I never took a stance on here. <br /><br />This biggest moving factor has been banks, yes, who&#39;ve received TARP funds from Obama -- which has helped the stock prices move upwards. <br /><br />Earnings reports are completely independent from the gov&#39;t intervention -- at least with the companies that have reported so far.<br /><br />I mentioned the G20 as part of the rally, yet you seem to think that I&#39;m so radically republican that I can&#39;t admit when Obama does something right; this is insulting. The fact that you have a hard time admitting that there are other factors involved that influence a market, and a true capitalist market, that are further reaching than the President.		</div>

						No.  I can, in fact, deny that on Nov. 6, the reaction was because of his election.  I can do this because:<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>The market isn&#39;t that simple by your own admission.</b></span><br /><br />Basically you&#39;ve said that when the market fell after the bailout under Bush, things were some complex that mere mortals such as myself couldn&#39;t possibly understand it and that there were so many factors that it couldn&#39;t be pinned on the bailout.  Then you said that when the markets fell after Obama was elected (not when he was inaugurated mind you) that it was an entirely correlative occurrence.  Now the rally that has been going on for the last 2 to 3 weeks we&#39;re back to &quot;too complicated to say&quot;.<br /><br /><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/ay7cb6.jpg" class="linked-image" alt="image" style="border: 0px;" /><br /><br />I won&#39;t deny that there are factors other than out president at play.  Not even when things are great.  But you sure seemed ready to say that he was the only factor when things sucked.  Weird.<br /><br />edit:  I&#39;d just like to see you be consistent.		</div>

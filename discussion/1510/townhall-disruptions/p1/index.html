						Agreed.  It is totally fine to go to a town hall meeting and ask tough questions or rattle off facts to try to make the politician you don&#39;t agree with look bad, but shouting him down is useless.		</div>

						These people know very little about the issues. What they do know about certain issues is spun to suit religious and moral rationals while detailing few actual facts. Why is it surprising that when addressing the issues that these people know little about and have already formed opinions based in their steadfast ideologies, they react irrationally and with aggression. These townhall meetings are challenging their worldviews. They have been fed ignorance their whole lives, and now with the truth presenting itself they must face the hypocrisy.		</div>

						I find it somewhat hard to believe, personally, that all across the country, in the space of a week, like minded (read batshit crazy) conservatives all came to the same conclusion that the way to keep the governmetn out of your healthcare was to sit in a townhall and yell at their senators.  Impossible, no.  But it seems unlikely that they aren&#39;t taking their orders from somewhere.  Not in a nefarious way, in a Rush Limbaugh talked about how participation in democracy was the best way to demostrate your dissention for 3 hours one day and then the idea got legs.  And I don&#39;t believe for a second that Limbaugh, Hannity, Kilmeade, O&#39;Reilly, et al are not in collusion with the GOP.  But that might be where I jump the shark.		</div>

						Sure they are in collusion with the GOP (in that the GOP needs votes and wants to pander to them) but the GOP does not even get close to advocating all of the policies they want.<br /><br />And I really do think these are just localized groups (sure they may be revved up from talk radio but who is telling them what local meetings to go to?).		</div>

						I don&#39;t think all of the people showing up to these meetings are organized nationally, but probably some of them are.

						People that protest his health care reform are not called the &quot;mob.&quot;  People that show up to town halls that are designed to discuss the legitimate merits of such reform and resort to shouting down the assembly are the people being labeled the &quot;mob.&quot;  If someone shows up to a town hall meeting, attempts to engage in an honest public discourse about the dangers or drawbacks of the planned health care bill, and they are instead shouted at until they are basically forced to stop speaking, then you could apply the &quot;mob&quot; title right back to those who support the health care reform.		</div>

						What makes the dichotomy false is that in one instance, people were organizing to support a political campaign, and in the other people are organizing to oppose a political agenda.<br /><br />It&#39;s not even the same as what Code Pink did.  They just went to events and did their protesting from outside the earshot of the event itself, since that&#39;s how the last administration rolled.  These people are *protesting* at a Town Hall Meeting.<br /><br />This is more like going into a courtroom where a guy you like is being tried for murder, and not letting the prosecution speak without you yelling about their last trip abroad.  Except when you get kicked out of the courtroom and possibly charged with a crime, nobody takes you seriously when you bitch about being oppressed.<br /><br />I&#39;d also like to point out that the ONLY people who have used the word &quot;mob&quot; in this thread are Evestay&#39;s article, KP&#39;s post bitching about the characterization of the right by the left described in said article, and Court pointing out that the word doesn&#39;t pertain to all organized political movements, just the ones that engage in thuggery.<br /><br />So frankly, I don&#39;t know what the fuck has you two riled up so much.  <br /><br />5 years ago, liberals doing somewhat similar things (though they simply weren&#39;t permitted the same amount of power in the national dialogue), were labeled un-american, traitors and terrorist sympathizers.

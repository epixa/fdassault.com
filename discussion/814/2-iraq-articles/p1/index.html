						New Premises in Iraq<br />Prospects for Withdrawal Have to Be Viewed Through the Lens of Progress<br />by Henry Kissinger<br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/30/AR2008073002947.html?hpid=opinionsbox1" target="_blank">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/conte...id=opinionsbox1</a><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">These premises have been overtaken by events. Almost all objective observers agree that major progress has been made on all three fronts of the Iraq war: Al-Qaeda, the Sunni jihadist force recruited largely from outside the country, seems on the run in Iraq; the indigenous Sunni insurrection attempting to restore Sunni predominance has largely died down; and the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad has, at least temporarily, mastered the Shiite militias that were challenging its authority. After years of disappointment, we face the need to shift gears mentally to consider emerging prospects of success. <br /><br />Of course, we cannot tell now whether these changes are permanent or whether, and to what extent, they reflect a decision by our adversaries, including Iran, to husband their forces for the aftermath of the Bush administration. But we do know that the outcome of the conflict will determine the kind of world in which the new administration will have to conduct its policies. Any appearance that radical Islamic forces were responsible for a U.S. defeat would have enormous destabilizing consequences far beyond the region. How and when to leave Iraq will therefore emerge as a principal decision for the new president.</div><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">A strategic reserve can now be created by the United States out of some of the forces currently in Iraq, with some moving to other threatened areas and others returning to the United States. American deployment is transformed from abdication into part of a geopolitical design. Its culmination should be a diplomatic conference charged with establishing a formal peace settlement. Such a conference was first assembled two years ago on the foreign ministers&#39; level. It was composed of all of Iraq&#39;s neighbors, including Iran and Syria; Egypt; and the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. That conference should be reassembled and charged with defining an international status for Iraq and the guarantees to enforce it.</div><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">The American presence in Iraq should not be presented as open-ended; this would not be supported by either Iraqi or American domestic opinion. But neither should it be put forward in terms of rigid deadlines. Striking this balance is a way for our country to come together as a constructive outcome emerges. Thirty years ago, Congress cut off aid to Vietnam and Cambodia two years after American troops had been withdrawn and local forces were still desperate to resist. Domestic divisions had overcome all other considerations. We must not repeat the tragedy that followed. <br /><br />The next president has a great opportunity to stabilize Iraq and lay the basis for a decisive turn in the war against jihadist radicalism and for a more peaceful Middle East. Surely he will want to assess the situation on the ground before setting a strategy for his term. He should not be limited by rigid prescriptions to vindicate maxims of the past, no matter how plausible they once seemed. Withdrawal is a means; the end is a more peaceful and hopeful world.</div><br /><br /><br />Al-Qaeda in Iraq Leader May Be in Afghanistan<br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/30/AR2008073003239.html?nav=rss_world" target="_blank">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/conte...l?nav=rss_world</a><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">BAGHDAD, July 30 -- The leader of the Sunni insurgent group al-Qaeda in Iraq and several of his top lieutenants have recently left Iraq for Afghanistan, according to group leaders and Iraqi intelligence officials, a possible further sign of what Iraqi and U.S. officials call growing disarray and weakness in the organization.<br /><br />U.S. officials say there are indications that al-Qaeda is diverting new recruits from going to Iraq, where its fighters have suffered dramatic setbacks, to going to Afghanistan and Pakistan, where they appear to be making gains.</div><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">A largely homegrown insurgent group that American officials believe is led by foreigners, al-Qaeda in Iraq has long been one of the most ruthless and dangerous organizations in the country. But even some of its leaders acknowledge that it has been seriously weakened over the past year.<br /><br />The number of foreign fighters entering Iraq has dropped to 20 a month, down from about 110 a month last summer and as many as 50 a month earlier this year, according to a senior U.S. intelligence analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the nature of his work.</div><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Lihebi, a former Iraqi air force technician in his 40s, said one of Masri&#39;s key errors was fiercely attacking the Awakening movement, former Sunni insurgents who are now paid by the U.S. military, instead of trying to win back their support.<br /><br />Indiscriminate attacks on civilians also caused the group to lose the support of local Sunni residents, Lihebi said.<br /><br />&quot;Al-Qaeda losing the Sunni population is like a human being losing the ability to drink water,&quot; he said. &quot;Because of Masri&#39;s weak personality and leadership, al-Qaeda in Iraq was weakened and split and lost the Sunni population.&quot;<br /><br />Earlier this month, Lihebi said his fighters would no longer pledge obedience to Masri and were withdrawing from al-Qaeda in Iraq because of the &quot;escalating hate against them by Sunnis due to the useless operations that ignored the main enemy, which is the head of evil, the United States.&quot;</div><br /><br />So, Kissinger wants to frame the possibility for a US withdrawal as being due to our recent success and as not being tied to a timeline in order to keep current gains.  And, AQI has been decimated by the surge and by the Sunni Awakening, which plays into Kissinger claiming progress.		</div>

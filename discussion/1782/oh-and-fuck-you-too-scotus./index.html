If within sheeple is outraged then doing isn&#39;t because sometimes all the should doing in the world can&#39;t outrage any more than none.  When all the outrage is losing without than longer to it becomes nigh impossible for under to tall enough.  I suggest that under advisement of law we act looking like.

It wasn&#39;t so much that the SCotUS felt that WalMart needed more freedom of expression in elections. It was more that the Westport County Bridge Players association was likewise being barred from buying airtime on the local television station within 1 month of a federal election letting people know they felt that Joe Politician is in fact a total sleazeball. Individually the membership probably can&#39;t afford the ad&#39;s, but collectively, they can.<br /><br />Broad spectrum and sweeping laws have broad impacts. Imagine that.</div><br />Right.  And who do you suppose benefits more from this decision, the Bridge Players, or Wal*Mart?  This doesn&#39;t give a voice to the Bridge Players, it drowns them out.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Oh like the rights &quot;granted&quot; to black people in the 1950&#39;s in regards to public education? How about &quot;Miranda Rights&quot; which while derived from the 5th Amendment, didn&#39;t &quot;exist&quot; until Miranda vs Arizona in 1966? Or the &quot;right to choose&quot; in the 1970&#39;s w/ Roe vs Wade?  I&#39;m sure we could keep going on if you like...</div><br />1. The Civil Rights Act extended natural rights to ALL people, explicitly, and expanded the definition of &quot;people&quot; in a direct way.<br />2. Miranda Rights are legal rights.  And yes.  They could be revoked.<br />3. Same with that pesky right to choose.  It won&#39;t, but as a legal right, it could be.<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Considering shareholders don&#39;t (generally) have that much direct input on the operations of a corporation, I think that is a minimal concern. And judging by a certain Supreme Court justice&#39;s reaction(mouthing &quot;That&#39;s not true, that&#39;s simply not true&quot;) to Obama during the State of the Union address, I&#39;d say the justices would make a distinction with foreign owned/controlled corporations should that ever come before the court.</div><br /><br />That&#39;s a lot of assuming.  And much of it is based on the current composition of our government as well as our economic and political climate TODAY.  Maybe you should read the other 4 justices dissenting opinions.  If this were no big deal, perhaps it wouldn&#39;t be a 5-4 vote.<br /><br />-------------<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">The &quot;other side&quot; of the coin is that historically the funding gap for purchased <span style="text-decoration: underline;">corporate advertising</span> on behalf of a party or candidate has been within 1% of an even 50% split for the past several election cycles.<br /><br />Now if you&#39;re discussing Union funded advertising(and it&#39;s funny how upset they are), it&#39;s tended to be more in the 80% range for Democratic issues/candidates, and 10% range for Republican issues/candidates. And they&#39;re the two biggest spenders in any election cycle so far.<br /><br />...I highly doubt <span style="text-decoration: underline;">corporate</span> funding practices with regards to political advocacy campaigns in regards to Democrats and Republicans is going to change appreciably in light of this change.</div><br /><br />Your doubt is noted...  <br /><br />Meanwhile, China&#39;s CIC just annouced that they&#39;ve been using our debt with them to purchase shares of US corporations for the past several years to the tune of a few billion dollars.

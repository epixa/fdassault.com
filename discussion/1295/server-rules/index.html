						The issue of what the exact rules for certain things I noticed has kept coming up.  It would probably be a good idea to put a list together of &#39;exactly&#39; what the rules are going to be. <br /><br />My only other input is to ask whoever is going to decide what they are actually going to be, to read through what the rules used to be, and unless I&#39;m mistaken, there was a fairly detailed list of the reasoning and the why behind the actual rules somewhere as well.		</div>

Most rounds went to within 15 seconds of the time limit anyway.</div><br />you&#39;re right on about the demo thing i believe.<br /><br />I suppose whether a ct should go in/t&#39;s come out depends on the round length; I hadn&#39;t thought of that.  Try keeping your sentiments with 5 minute rounds <img src="src" alt="image" />/tongue.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid=":P" border="0" alt="tongue.gif" /&gt; (but like you said for fd&#39;s shorter rounds, it seems fine)<br /><br />for someone looking to take up ban mod, here is my description of it: Banmod is about knowing what is beyond the capacity of play as well as beyond the capacity of the game, so it requires both a good understanding of the game, including how it is played, and a confidence in that understanding.  It&#39;s interesting since it&#39;s a puzzle, with some harder than others.  It&#39;s best to have a strong sense of morality (and a good self conception of it) because there is a lot to decide in the outset of taking the position, such as what level of uncertainty to ban. There are some obvious ones, and there are a lot of trends in the style of play of cheaters, but every so often you get a clever one or one who only uses certain aspects of a hack (it&#39;s easier to cover up a wall hack than aimbot, for instance, and the 3rd person hack takes a lot of skill to detect and, still, some luck), and you need to decide how sure need to be.  I hear people objecting to this, that one must be 100% sure each time, but there are a lot of cases where actions can be interpreted as both cheating, both when and when not cheating, and as banmod, you&#39;ll need to decide how the relationship between those two is factored into your decision.  I&#39;ve seen people get banned for aimbots when they were cleaning their mouse, or because the admin didn&#39;t realize with a lower dpi, a mouse can act crazy and shake for a second when moved faster than it can track (this happens often with a low sensitivity and the common 400dpi mouse).  You also must decide how much outside influence to take, which might be the hardest problem.  You are ban moderator, which means, for instance, either it&#39;s your decision, or it&#39;s up to you to make the best decision, and those are not the same.  And every problem is magnified when it&#39;s a clan member, or to a lesser extent a regular, to the point that it really is scary.  It&#39;s similar to if you and only you decide who should and shouldn&#39;t be in donut except worse because s/he&#39;s already in donut.<br /><br />Gray area is not only in whether someone is cheating but whether the rules cover the situation.  The first is met with experience, but the second is only met with intelligence in judgement, and there&#39;s no saying if you&#39;re right or not (unless you decide to greatly consider outside opinion, I suppose).  The second keeps one up at night.<br /><br />You should already know the common elements in a cheater&#39;s gameplay going in; it&#39;s not something to learn along the way.  If you&#39;ve never tried a hack, you shouldn&#39;t be ban moderator.  In fact, you&#39;re foolish for even considering it if you haven&#39;t. Would you trust a fireman who has never worked a firetruck but has been to a fire or two?  (That said, I&#39;m not saying you should.  In fact, if you haven&#39;t, then know that public cheats are often boobytrapped with things like setinfo lines that let people know you&#39;ve cheated even after uninstalling. You will get caught--or else the position of ban moderator is pointlessly useless anyway).  If you see someone going into a corner and not moving for a few seconds, or perhaps it looks like he hit an arrow key once, if either of those things doesn&#39;t raise your suspicion, stick with admin and leave ban mod to someone else.  Such &#39;virginity&#39; in regard to the vices of CS is not a bad thing, but it makes you wrong for the job.<br /><br />In the other direction, it also helps if you know how better CS players play to help frame in your mind what is good versus what is cheating.  If you watch professional matches, great.  Videos are alright to a lesser extent. <br /><br />To counter all the bad news and warnings I&#39;ve managed to give, it really is interesting in a way that&#39;s never dull, and it&#39;s important to the community. What I mean to say is it&#39;s rewarding for all the grief, though the grief matters--at best you do a service for the community at a disservice to others; if you aren&#39;t grieving, the job should go to someone else. You are St. Peter, keeping Heaven heavenly for the good by turning some brothers out to Hell, except Peter has God&#39;s judgement to lean on.<br /><br />I&#39;m sure I forgot and have forgotten a ton of things, and I have tried to keep the choices I made in the position out of what I wrote, but I&#39;m happy to go over any concerns a candidate has, so should the reader be a candidate, shoot me a PM if you want.		</div>

						I think it&#39;s important to have a demo since that gives a server a better class of players. You don&#39;t want to be the really good player who people think hacks and will ban him without any proof. I&#39;m banned from too many places based on what people think and not the proof they have. It gets old...Now I also see where you come from saying that there is a long list of trustworthy people saying someone is hacking, and it could be completely obvious but with no proof it&#39;s like it never happened and when they say &quot;hey why did you ban me, what did I do wrong?&#33;&quot; we&#39;ll have we saw you hacking in our server and we banned you. They&#39;ll inevitably ask &quot;do you have a demo? No? I never even did that&#33; You got the wrong guy.&quot;		</div>

						Stephen, I don&#39;t entirely agree that if you&#39;ve never hacked you shouldn&#39;t be a ban moderator, and I don&#39;t think your analogy with the fireman is entirely accurate either.  I think what you&#39;re saying about hacking is more along the lines of would you trust a fireman who never participated in arson themselves.  I think you can definitely have enough understanding of hacks without using them to be put in a position to pass judgment on situations like a ban appeal.  That&#39;s not say that being a one-time hacker yourself wouldn&#39;t help do the job better, but I don&#39;t think it is a requirement by any means.<br /><br />Overall though, I agree with your assessment about rules and ban moderation.<br /><br />I also think the amount of rules that you must set up and strictly abide by is very dependent on the quality and quantity of the admins on the server.  I don&#39;t think you need a particular rule about demoing in place to handle a situation like last night.  Ultimately I think it was handled the way it should have been (although having more admins than the amount you have now would certainly have helped the situation).  That particular case wasn&#39;t demo-worthy, and the people that witnessed it and the admin that banned the hackers recognized that.		</div>

						What&#39;s so hard about recording a demo?  I used to do it all the time.  So did most of us.  Sometimes just for funsies.<br /><br />It&#39;s nice knowing that if you appeal your ban that they will either have evidence to refer to, or you are scott free.  As a guy in the category of never-cheated-in-counterstrike I can say that while I&#39;m not and never have been good enough to be accused of hacking on FD, I did get it every now and again on crappier servers.  The better you are, the more it happens, of course.  And I don&#39;t think we want good players to feel threatened by their own goodness when people call them hackers.<br /><br />It was always really nice to be able to say, &quot;Get a demo and submit the ban.  We&#39;ll see who&#39;s hacking.&quot;<br /><br />It is also really easy to do and frankly in one server I policed for a while, simply seeing me drop out of the round and into spec was occasionally enough to get people to leave.<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE (Brian &#64; Apr 16 2009, 09&#58;47 PM) <a rel="nofollow" href="index.php?act=findpost&amp;pid=15937">&lt;{POST_SNAPBACK}&gt;</a></div><div class="quotemain">Too much talk.<br /><br />Keep it simple, stupids.</div><br /><br /><br />Were you around for the damn near 2 months of discussion revolving around round/buy times?<br /><br />These discussions are CRUCIAL damnit&#33;<br /><br />&lt;3		</div>

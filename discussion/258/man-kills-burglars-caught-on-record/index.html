						<object width="464" height="392"><param name="movie" value="http://embed.break.com/NDA5NDQw" /><embed src="http://embed.break.com/NDA5NDQw" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="464" height="392" /></object><br /><br />While the title of the clip says that he killed 2 burglars, I don't want to jump to any conclusions, so I'll summarize from what I heard:  A man witnesses two people break into his neighbor's house, so he calls 911.  The man gives all the information he could and tried to speed the dispatcher along, but it takes too long for the police to get out there.  The burglars start to leave the premises, so the man informs the dispatcher that he's going to put a stop to it.  He grabs his shotgun and leaves his house and seem to put the phone down.  You hear him yell something like 'Move and you're dead,' then you hear him fire.  He comes back to the phone and tells the dispatcher (while clearly pumping with adrenaline) that he needs to get police out there <i>now</i> because one of the robbers is 'down' on the lawn.  He puts the gun back inside his house, lays down on his grass, and appears to be arrested by arriving police.<br /><br />I don't really know how this story ends since the clip stops immediately following the arrival of police, but it's an interesting story.  Do you think this was justified?  Do you think it was a smart move?  Would your opinion vary depending whether he actually killed one, both, or neither of the burglars?<br /><br />Personally, I think this was well deserved and a sign of an excellent neighbor and citizen.  The man did his best to contact the police and clearly waited for the police to get out there until he thought it was too late, so he took the law into his hands.  He yelled a warning (it's hard to tell how clear it was since he was far from the phone), and apparently fired after that warning was not heeded.  He may have been a little aggressive and quick to jump the gun (no pun intended), but in the end he stopped a crime from happening (or at least stopped any more from happening) and protected his neighbor's property.  To me, that's justice.		</div>

						If they were leaving the premises and were in no way &quot;threatning&quot; this mans life, he was not justified. Shooting them for trying to get away with merchandise is not a justification for shooting them. However, if they were to pull a gun on him, or run at him with a knife, where he felt threatened, then his shooting would be justified a self defense.		</div>

						<div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Do you think this was justified? Do you think it was a smart move? Would your opinion vary depending whether he actually killed one, both, or neither of the burglars?</div> As gachi basically said it depends on whether he fired into the robbers back while fleeing the property or if the crook presented immediate physical threat to someone. Usually as far as the courts are concerned its murder unless you are defending yourself or someone else from physical harm. <br />In my mind thats not serving justice. My guess is the burglar still had a life, friends and family, and as far as they are concerned his life is worth a lot more than the stolen items (if he was even fleeing with any?). Im sure the dead man would agree. Likewise times are different these days. Self defense laws where drafted in the days when individuals were more independent. If i was a pioneer of the west and a bandit wanted my rations or my firearms damn well I would shoot him. These days are obviously over though as far as our country is concerned. Insurance and lawsuites replace the gun in every individuals hand and the rest is left to law enforcement.<br />Either way, if the man knew as little as it seems the killshot was unjustified. As seen all over the news all the time, these situations are tricky even for law enforcement who are allegedly up to par psychologically and physically for such a situation (not all are). <br /><br /><br />My way to handle would be verbal warning, warning shot (almost always makes them stop), then depending on the circumstances pursue (still armed of course), or if necessary go for a temp disabling shot (necessary as in: only in the event that I KNEW he had inflicted death/serious harm to my neihgbors)<br /><br /><br /><br />It would suck to drop some hooded figure with a load of buckshot, roll him over and its some 16 year old kid just breakin in on a dare. Not that this was the case, its just something to keep in mind when the adrenaline starts pumping and the fingers on the trigger.		</div>

						I feel no sympathy for the burglar.  Some laws aren&#39;t that serious.  Going onto someone&#39;s property and stealing their belongings that they had to work for, I believe there is something in the constitution about that being wrong.  So it isn&#39;t so much that what they are stealing is worth less than their lives, but the fact that they are willing to commit a crime like that warrants any action, other than something along the lines of cruel and unusual punishment. What this man did was display good citizenship and being a good neighbor. The fact that the burglar would be able to sue this man by law is disgusting.  There is no real reason why someone would have to break into someone&#39;s house and steal their belongings.  I don&#39;t believe in the whole &quot;you don&#39;t know what they might be going through&quot; crap.  If the current justice system doesn&#39;t suffice to protect the people, then I have no problem with the people taking justice into their own hands.  Especially not in this case.  If the burglar was given fair warning, then I feel no sympathy for the man doing what he needed to do to stop the crime from happening.		</div>

						<div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">to stop the crime from happening.</div><br />thats the point is that it has already happened, and the man decided to intervene in the &quot;pursuit&quot; stage. No one gets the death penalty for breaking and entering, even if you add theft. The court keeps this in mind if you have just shot a fleeing suspect. There are prisons instead of firing squads for those specific criminals. If you REALLY want to stop a man, and you are going to use a firearm, you need to know that if you place the bead in between his shoulder blades, even with bird shot, that man is dead almost for sure. Then you need to be able to decide in about .5 seconds whether or not the police apprehend him, take a less than lethal shot at the extremities or shoulder or ass ending the scenario and allowing the justice system to dish out a jail sentence, OR shoot him in the spine- death for sure. If you shoot him in the spine and go before a jury, the prosecution will ask the jury to take into consideration that you HAD those options, and that you chose the last. murder.<br />Unfortunately the justice system cannot protect you against a man running in and out of your house, that is up to you. As far as serving justice at the level of taking someones life, the law these days says its NOT up to you, whether you like it or not. Beyond that its your individual capacity for understanding in reasoning. This robber may not be a BAD man and may not deserve to die. He may be mislead, uneducated, born of a crackhead mother but non the less a human. If its the latter he needs jail time, not necessarily death. You have to think... in todays society you arent really serving justice by killing that man, your only serving justice by stopping him. Too you,  if theres no difference between a kill shot and simply stopping the man  you don&#39;t need to be holding that firearm in the first place.		</div>

						<div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">but in this world even worst people are protected from anything and I find it outragous.</div><br />And thats the irony of mans imperfectness =/ The freedoms provided by our laws are the best method of protection for the most vile criminals unfortunately.

What better way to get closer to the enemy than sit in his front yard? none, go for it if you can use his own laws for your protection (rights to privacy). Same principle applies if you want to rob a man, why not if he can&#39;t shoot you on the run? thats the mentality, and it adapts as the laws changes.

						definitely deserved i think. if you mess with someone else&#39;s shit you run the risk of getting your day fucked up. Maybe try to shoot him in the leg instead of to kill. i know it&#39;s hard with adrenaline and other situational intangibles, but some responsibility must be attributed to the holder of the gun.

The point you make is self defense which is perfectly legal. You can defend yourself if you think a burglar is in your house and he might harm you / your family. In the above case, this man had nothing else to do with this case rather than just being a neighbor. He could have obviously STAYED OUT of the situation. He wasn&#39;t dragged into it for self defense or any other reason that allows us to harm another person.<br /><br />The fact of the matter is that the person went out purposely (as heard on the phone call) to shoot those guys. That&#39;s what the cops are for. So this is one of the several cases where some might believe cops came very late, so what? That does not give you the right to do whatever you want to them. I&#39;m pretty sure the cops would have stopped them. They were apparently there 20 seconds after the shooting? If they were getting away on foot, how far could they go? If they were getting away in a car, he could have let them get in and shot the tires or something? There are other ways of stopping people without shooting/killing them. <br /><br />And I think he&#39;s retarded for saying all those things on the Phone. Oh, I&#39;m going to go out now. Sir, plz dont. No, you hear the shotgun clicking...		</div>

						If you want to be badass and take the law into your hands, you can chase the guys on foot (take your gun with you). Its a little lazy and a bit hasty to drop them with a kill shot without even pursuing. The police would pursue first also, if they did what they are trained to do. I&#39;m sorry old man lived his life off of hamburgers and fries couldnt chase the guy down till he had him pointblank. the fool isn&#39;t running then. If he tries to, melee with the buttstock inbetween the shoulderblades, he will go down very quickly. Then you don&#39;t have to deal with the bullshit of whoever represents him trying to sue you.<br /><br />Again, if you cannot handle the situation properly, don&#39;t handle it at all. If theres no other way to handle THAT situation than with a killshot from a firearm, you don&#39;t have the experience to deal with the situation safely.<br />NOW, if you were the neighbors, your in your bed with your wife and the shadowy figure busts through your bedroom door go ahead and fire if you want, you will get away with it most likely.		</div>

						Chapter 9 of the Texas Penal Code allows &quot;third party&quot; protection, by use of force, of someone elses property as long as the actor felt he had a legal duty to do so, or, if the owner requested it.<br /><br />I heard that when the men left the nieghbor&#39;s house they came onto his lawn. That will have bearing on the case. The Castle law has been changed and you no longer have to retreat but can defend your life and property. I do not know this case, but he may not be convicted.		</div>

Yes, it&#39;s probably going to end up harming him for intervening in a crime and using deadly force, but I think it was bloody well justified.<br /><br />Now, for the running. 100 meters, at the very, absolute least. I took their load into consideration; a bare, average man can get 15 in 1.5 seconds. I was being very moderate there. <br /><br />Moreover, the police have to arrive at the scene first, and then proceed after getting information about the current situation. Then they could pursue. They could be long fucking gone by then. Yes it was foolish for him to do go outside despite warning, but I also think it admirable.</div><br />Calm down there buddy.<br /><br />Even if they run 15 meters in 1.5 seconds (which is not true unless your an athlete. 15 meters is like.. 30 something feet. ) The current record is 10 seconds for 100 meters ( looked it up). That&#39;s the speed you mentioned above. So the whole 15 meters in 1.5 seconds is out of the question. <br /><br />So police do have to come to the scene, they dispatcher should have already told them what to look for (the guy does describe the clothing). therefor if a patrol car is coming down the block and sees a guy with that cloth description carrying something in his bag, the most obvious thing to do would be to stop him. <br /><br />I&#39;m not sure if this is Texas law, but there&#39;s a law called &quot;make my day&quot; (i guess it&#39;s nicknamed that) where your allowed to shoot people for your property itself (no self defense needed). If he had done that to protect himself, I can understand, maybe even his property. But they were just on his lawn and im pretty sure they had their back on him. They were trying to leave. Self defense can&#39;t really (or shouldn&#39;t be rather) applied here.<br /><br />But then again, Texas laws concerning guns are different from NY Laws.		</div>

						I think we have brought it up before, but I thought almost universally, if anyone breaks into your house or garage, as long as they are still in the house or garage you can shoot to kill.  This is usually upheld in court because you are in danger, and Bill put it very nicely, if somebody is willing to get thru two or three locks/chains, they will not have a problem harming you as well.		</div>

						Its interesting to see the American perspectives on this, both tactical and legal.  Clearly I am not an American, so I will not be able to comment as to your laws.  However, in Canada this would have played out very poorly for this man.<br /><br />I feel incredibly sorry for this guy.  Joe did what he thought was right; however, I believe he did practically everything wrong:<br /><br />My number one issue with this entire clip is that Joe was given an order by a police dispatcher which he outright refused to follow.  The police dispatcher is trained, and knows that you as a civilian are not.  I would have to say that this dispatcher was TOP of the line, and did an amazing job.  His priorities were bang on, and the guy should get a raise.  We do not know what sort of training Joe has with his weapons, and we do not know what sort of experience he has with crime.  Going from the audio clip, I would unfortunately have to assume that he has had little of both.  Discharging a shotgun in a neighborhood is a stupid thing to do unless you have no other choice (life or death).  Joe cannot believe this is happening in &quot;this neighborhood&quot;, leading me to believe it is a middle to up class area.<br /><br />Now, a shotgun will most likely be loaded with either shot or slugs.  With slugs you have a very nasty problem, in that if you miss, the slug can easily penetrate house siding, cars, and practically anything else.  I will give Joe some credit here and assume he was not stupid enough to go after this guy loaded with slugs.  Making the assumption that Joe was going after this guy with 12 gauge buck has its own issues.  What sort of choke does he have on his weapon?  How far from the individual was he when he fired?  If you listen to the clip, he clearly fires his weapon 3 times... remember folks, there were two bad guys and Joe only downed one of them.  This means two loads of 12 gauge buck were emptied into that neighborhood.  Bullets (or shot in this case) don&#39;t just disappear when they miss something&#33;  Joe&#39;s lucky as hell that he didn&#39;t hit someone else with his rounds.  Coming from a different perspective on the same note: If Joe&#39;s two missed rounds hit property of any sort, he&#39;s likely caused more value in damage then the idiot thieves even had in their possession.<br /><br />Let&#39;s look at a new problem here.  What if Joe had Joe for a neighbor?  Joe2 looks outside at the sound of shots and sees Joe1 has shot a man with a shotgun, and is shooting more rounds at a fleeing man.  Neither man you can see has weapons.  Joe1 does not seem threatened in any way.  This is an outrage&#33;  Joe2 can&#39;t believe this would happen in this neighborhood&#33;  Joe2 immediately grabs a phone, calls 911, and goes out to confront the shoot before he gets away, shotgun at the ready.  Okayyy... suddenly this is a little bit more of a problem.<br /><br />Here&#39;s yet another problem.  Lets look at it from the arriving officer&#39;s perspective this time:<br /><br />Cop is responding to a reported &quot;break and enter with theft&quot; in progress.  According to Cop&#39;s trusty laptop, the civilian who called it in is armed with a shotgun and agitated.  Great.  Does this make Cop&#39;s job easier, or more difficult?  When Cop arrives on the scene, is he going to be focused on the fact that someone may (or may not&#33;) have broken into the house next door, or is he going to be focused on the fact that the guy who called is some jumpy motherfucker with a shotgun?  But as if that&#39;s not bad enough, 1:30 seconds (almost exactly) away from the call, your laptop is updated.  The complaintant has pursued the supposed suspects of the crime, and has been heard to be firing his shotgun.  Response codes are immediately increased, and extra officers are diverted.  Cop is about to turn onto the street when his laptop beeps again, telling him that a man has been shot by the complaintant... is this situation ideal?  Does anyone else see a problem with this?  Lets ignore for the moment the realtively minor fact that thief2 is practically guaranteed to get away now.  Remember... worst case scenario had Joe NOT taken action would be that both bad guys get away.  Lets not forget about the police factor here... many units and resources will have to be directed away from LEGITIMATE emergencies to deal with Joe&#39;s actions in this regard.  EMS, patrol units, detectives, etc all diverted from their original tasks to deal with this new problem.  At worst, this could mean the death of innocent civilians.  At best this means a delay in: EMS response, Patrol response, and detective case closures.<br /><br />So what did Joe accomplish... at the expense of all that I have listed above, he stopped one petty thief from getting away, and pretty much guaranteed the escape of the other (especially if thief1 dies).  He&#39;s lucky the criminals didn&#39;t have weapons of their own, or Joe could have been killed or injured, and would that be worth it?<br /><br />The last thing I am going to bring up is best and worse case scenarios for Joe acting and Joe not acting (direct impact only):<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Joe acts:</b></span><br /><br />Best case:  Both thieves apprehended without incident or violence, and the valuables are recovered.<br /><br />Worst case:  Innocent civilian(s) die(s)/Joe Dies/Cop dies<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Joe does not act:</b></span><br /><br />Best case: Both thieves apprehended without incident or violence, and the valuables are recovered.<br /><br />Worst case: Both thieves get away with the valuables and are never apprehended for their crimes.<br /><br />Weighing the best and worst outcomes, did Joe make the right choice?<br /><br />I say no.. definitely not.<br /><br />So there you have my Canadian perspective on things.<br /><br />P.S:  Monk, I&#39;m incredibly disappointed in all the talk about disabling shots and getting into CC with this guy.  Center mass, from as safe a distance as possible, always.  If you don&#39;t think a center mass shot is appropriate, shooting is not appropriate.  Use of force framework 101 =p		</div>

						Brian has a very valuable point about about the consequences of the mans actions.  I agree that the situation was nowhere near ideal.  The man in the heat of the moment made some critical bad decisions, because, basically, he wasn&#39;t able to think quickly enough, and based his actions more on instinct or reaction than thought.  So personally, in this situation, I think that what he did was a mistake.  But in a more hypothetical situation, I respect and appreciate what he did, and that he had the balls to actually do something.  If someone could act more professionally (warning shot, and a weapon more along the lines of a semi auto 22) I would have no problem with someone intervening like this man did, with no sympathy for the potential death(s) of the robbers.		</div>

There ARE situations, recognized by official law enforcement training standards or not, that dictate the use of a firearm to disable and not a kill shot. As for that specific situation I advised to pursue not to shoot the fleeing suspect <img src="src" alt="image" />/wink.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid=";)" border="0" alt="wink.gif" /&gt; The option of shooting a non center of mass comes in where he is 1. civilian, can act outside of law enforcement protocol 2. Extreme situation: man is on his driveway, looks at his neighbors and sees through the window someone has trashed their home and two bodies laying on the floor, a perpetrator actively skinning them with a knife. That grotesque detail in a court of law would act in your favor if during the situation it became clear the assailant was getting away NOW, and police were only just dispatched, and you decided to act then. If I was in that situation, no I would not take a killshot. If theres a problem with where I hit him, just say I had bad aim. I would rather that person sit in jail the rest of his life than have the peace of 3 second washed out death from a shot to the spine.		</div>

						Uh, I&#39;m gonna hope that you were being sarcastic about Jim Cramer. Considering he&#39;s a total idiot and averages 98% on the &quot;let&#39;s see how wrong I can be&quot; scale. <br /><br />AIG MAINLY served America. Fir example, 7/10 houses in California. The ripple effect from them failling would have been catastrphic.<br /><br />Please please please educate yourself. You spew a lot of intelligent garb on these forums, and every now and then what you say is horribly false. The problem for many of those who listen to you is that it&#39;s hard to detect when you&#39;re wrong. You&#39;re equally as passionate about everything you utter.		</div>

Nationalize Losses.  It&#39;s the American way.</span></div><br /><br />Are you still being sarcastic?  If 7/10 Americans lost their homes right now, the US during the great depression would look like a Utopian society.  One of the drawbacks to the ridiculous idea that every American family should own their home is that America has shifted its sitting wealth from their banks to their homes.  The &quot;guarantee&quot; of a complete return on their investment, if not a far greater return, and the availability of low-interest, long-term mortgages has led even well-off Americans to invest in their real estate.  Those 7/10 Americans didn&#39;t just buy houses, they&#39;ve borrowed against their houses with the expectation that their worth wouldn&#39;t depreciate.  It has allowed most Americans to live far beyond their means for a long time.  When they lose that house, they default on <i>all</i> of their credit and will have to file for bankruptcy.  Doing that means all of the credit agencies -- the credit card companies, the car dealership, the colleges, the states themselves, and even the local furniture store -- get no return on their loans.  If you want to talk about a ripple effect, think about the impact that would have on all of the businesses I just mentioned.  If they all didn&#39;t go bankrupt, they would suffer severe hits to their bottom line and millions of people will be laid off nation-wide.  With more people getting laid off, more houses will have to be sold, the housing market will get even more flooded, home prices will drop further, and suddenly the lower income of the remaining 3/10 would see their wealth plummet (you see, they invest their money in real estate as well).<br /><br />I <i>hate</i> the idea that we had to buy up an 80% stake in AIG.  I blame the federal government for all of their well-intentioned, but reckless policy-making over the past sixty years.  I blame the democrats for their over-zealous pursuit of the notion that every American should own a home, and I blame republicans for their bastardization of &quot;conservative&quot; economic principles that paved the way for the market to take advantage (at the expense of everyone else) of the democrats&#39; policies.  But I&#39;m not irrational about it.  If nothing was done, this &quot;crisis&quot; that we&#39;re seeing now would actually be disastrous.		</div>

						What percentage of homes owned in that 7/10 number (have poked around and not found any numbers at all actually) are people&#39;s second homes?  Speculated homes?

Any numbers elsewhere in the country?<br /><br />Even if it&#39;s all people&#39;s only homes, maybe it&#39;s time to hit the reset button instead of prolonging this ridiculous notion.<br /><br />What I&#39;m hearing is there&#39;s a bunch of imaginary wealth out there in people&#39;s real estate.

						You also never hear about the ripple effect of dumping 85 billion dollars out of the fed.  Just the ripple effect of doing nothing.  Can&#39;t wait to see the end of the year numbers on how much money went to saving failing companies in total.  The number will be staggering and we&#39;ll all bitch about what a waste it was.<br /><br />/I&#39;m just ahead of the curve.  <img src="src" alt="image" />/tongue.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid=":P" border="0" alt="tongue.gif" /&gt;<br />//we&#39;ve been scared shitless by all this ripple effect shit and I refused to be frightened into accepting a policy decision.

						SO from what I understand the majority opinion here is that if another global insurance company were about to go under you&#39;d support bailing them out as well?  What about two of them?  What about 2 more banks too (very likely in the next 4 months)?  And a couple of car manufacturers?<br /><br />I&#39;d like to see a little foresight about where what we&#39;re actually doing will lead, rather than speculation on what might happen if we don&#39;t take this path.  That would foster a discussion of merit rather than one of justification.		</div>

						Found some new information.  Came across <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.infowars.net/articles/September2008/180908Paul.htm" target="_blank">this bit of information</a> from the great oracle (emphasis added). <br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">&quot;Our problems come first of all from the Federal Reserve. It is a monopoly and it controls interest rates artificially low, causes people to make mistakes, that&#39;s the basic source. But then on top of that in the Housing market we had the <b>Community Reinvestment Act</b> which told investors that they had to loan to risky borrowers, and that was a risky complication. HUD contributes to this, FDIC contributes, it&#39;s called moral hazard, everything that we have done over here creates moral hazard, that is we assure people or assume that we will take care of everybody, just go out and create the risk, it is the opposite of the market place.&quot; Paul stated.<br />...<br />&quot;And then they have people come along and say &#39;see, this is the failure of capitalism&#39;, this has nothing to do with capitalism, this is something that started off as interventionism and us being too involved in the economy for the benefit of special interests. But now it is being socialized out in the open.&quot;</div><br /><br />So while reading the first paragraph above, I used my HyperWords FireFox add-on to wikipedia <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Reinvestment_Act" target="_blank">Community Reinvestment Act</a>.  And found out that he&#39;s right.  Our government created a system so that banks had to give out sub-prime loans.  I&#39;ve been blaming banks for being stupid this entire time.  I should have been angry at the government for forcing the banks to make these decisions.		</div>

						Im hoping that somebody can explain to me what exactly derivatives are. I was doing some research with a friend and we came across a few sites that really only offered a broad definition, if that. It seems to me that they dont really have any value, yet some of these banks have spent billions of dollars on them. <br /><br />I dont mean to push this thread in another direction, but I think It would be better than starting another thread. Any insight is appreciated. <br /><br /><br /><br />-John		</div>

American tax payers are bailing out American banks, British tax payers bailing out the British banks and so forth.<br /><br />Seems like you are bailing out a lot of financial instituitons.  While its not the everyday americans fault it is the ceo, boards, managers fault.  Most financial institutions in the UK, at least the big ones all have banking branches so they have hard currency coming into them to prop them up.

Most of the 10,000 people who worked for LEH, and now BarCap had nothing to do with subprimes or the financial crisis.

						First of all, 10k employees getting 2.5 bn dollars.  That&#39;s 250,000 per employee.  Do you see this going evenly to all employees in the pool or being distributed according to &quot;contribution&quot;.  I expect it goes primarily to the upper 1-5% of the leadership as they are jumping to another company/industry.  Maybe they&#39;ll become lobbyists... <img src="src" alt="image" />/sleep.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid="-_-" border="0" alt="sleep.gif" /&gt;  I don&#39;t know of course, but I never said I was outraged or anything, the article referred to outrage expressed by Lehman staff in London over their getting the shaft in this deal.<br /><br />Mostly I can&#39;t get too pissed cause this isn&#39;t my money going to them, but how many employees of Lehman NY did I watch walk out of that high rise with nothing but their cubicle in a box and a growing understanding of how hard it will be to find a job with all their fellow employees looking as well?  Right before christmas, too.  (Did they get their jobs back in this Barclay buyout?  I never heard anything about that, actually.)		</div>

						As for the division of said bonuses, I cannot begin to guess where it is. But the compensation paid is pretty much aligned with the rest of the street. Upper management will make more, but the really high up people (CEO, COO, etc) have already declined to receive a bonus.<br /><br />I packed away most of my stuff, as did almost everybody here -- just as an &quot;in case&quot;  scenario. If LBHI filed chapter 7 and the building was included, it was possible the government would essentially lock the doors and turn the lights off.<br /><br />People who lost their jobs, or left, to my understanding from what I&#39;ve read in publicly disseminated information are not getting offers from Barclays. However,  Barclays is offering some 12,000 jobs until December 31st, which will cover bonuses for those retained.		</div>

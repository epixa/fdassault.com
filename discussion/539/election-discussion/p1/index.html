						So who do you all like the most?<br /><br />So I think we can all agree that by &quot;War hero&quot; McCain means POW.  And I can&#39;t imagine that somebody who was held in a Vietnamese prison camp has all his marbles together.  Seems a little harsh, but that bitch is straight crazy.  Good at hiding it perhaps, but crazy nonetheless.  Don&#39;t forget he called vietnamese &quot;gooks&quot; on his Straight Talk Express back in the day.  That&#39;s a great way for a president to make friends abroad.<br /><br />Hillary seems to be basing her campaign on experience.  Though she could draw on her experience as a Senator she&#39;s chosen to cite her contributions in the White House as first lady to Bill.  She&#39;d like us to believe that she single handedly drafted, campainged for and had passed two things in particular.  NAFTA and SCHIP.  Both are all sunshine and rainbows and unicorn poop on the surface.  Health care for 6 million kids&#33;?  Awesome.  A continental free trade agreement&#33;?  Let&#39;s usher in a brighter tomorrow today&#33;  Too bad the guy who ACTUALLY drafted SCHIP doesn&#39;t even recall talking to her, or even hearing her name.  And her 11,000 pages of meetings haven&#39;t really turned up anything substantial regarding NAFTA.  aw.<br /><br />And Obama.  Seems really sane to most folks.  But when he had to climb off his 10-straight-victories high horse he started to play the same games as everybody else.  Embellishing his (short) legislative career, failing to realize that just about 75% of PA ISN&#39;T philadelphia and is in fact populated by bigots.  The only thing that can save him here is that bigots are just as likely to not vote if they have to choose between a black man and a woman.  But the recent controversy swirling around his pastor Rev. Wright just seemed to lose him significant ground.  So he makes a speech about race in Philly.  A good strat, but too easy to trump by talking about something that a president can actually act on... like the economy.  Which is what Hillary is doing.<br /><br />I like Obama and all, but the more I see the more it looks like McCain is gonna clinch it when it counts.  And all this BS going on in the Dem. party is just fueling his fire.  He gets to run around the country pointing at his two favorite clowns and nobody notices when he says that Iran is supporting Al&#39;Qaeda or confuses Sunni&#39;s and Shi&#39;a.<br /><br />My vote&#39;s with the crazy black man.		</div>

						He&#39;s definitely not a perfect candidate.  And there are some doubts as to whether he would beat McCain.  (See that map)  But yeah, he&#39;s pretty awesome overall.  My concerns are all related to beating McCain.  That guy is straight crazy...  and doesn&#39;t seem to know much about anything beyond getting elected.  <br /><br />I read an interesting review of Obama&#39;s &quot;race speech&quot; which pointed out it was probably way too well written and pointed for most Americans to get, and that all anyone sees when they read it is &quot;I&#39;m not gonna say my pastor is satan because he said God damn America.&quot;  Super unfortunate, but more than likely it&#39;s the case.<br /><br />Basically he&#39;s not the sub-par one.  We are.  <br /><br />(is totally voting for his shit on 4/22 anyway... 11,000 pages of schedules doesn&#39;t not make you a transparent politician... sorry)		</div>

						It&#39;s also interesting to note that there are 566 remaining delegates.  Clinton has 1472.5 now, and Obama has 1622.5<br /><br />2024 are required to clinche the nomination.<br /><br />That means Clinton has 551.5 to go and Obama has just 401.5<br /><br />Point?  Clinton would have to be running for nomination without an opponent to even have the chance to be nominated by traditional means.  Obama also has a just the slimmest chance.<br /><br />According to polls, Obama should get between 60 and 70 from PA, about 30 from Indiana, about 55 to 60 from North Carolina and another 8 from West Virginia as well as another 14 or so from Oregon.  Making for between 167 and 182... not quite the 401 he needs...<br /><br />Hillary&#39;s no better with 80 something from PA about 20 from Indiana another 50 from North Carolina 15 from West Virginia and 18 from Oregon.  She&#39;s looking at 183 ish.  Neck a neck with Obama in the biggest of the States that are left but still lagging by a solid hundred or so.<br /><br />But who cares?  Neither can win this way.		</div>

McCain confuse Sunni and Shiite, Iran and Al Qaeda,&quot; said Obama. &quot;Maybe that is why he voted to go to war with a country that had no Al Qaeda ties. Maybe that is why he completely fails to understand that the war in Iraq has done more to embolden America&#39;s enemies than any strategic choice that we have made in decades.&quot;</div><br />sounds like Obama buys into John Edwards ridiculous assertion that there is no such thing as the Global War on Terror		</div>

						So given the choice between a candidate who only served for 6 years in the Illinois state legislature and 2 years in Congress and a candidate who served 20 years in Congress, 6 years in state legislatures, and 4 years in a presidential cabinet, you&#39;d choose the latter?  Luckily, you weren&#39;t alive to vote in that election otherwise you would have voted for James Buchanan (one of the worst presidents in our history) over Abraham Lincoln (one of the best).<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2008/Info/experience.html" target="_blank">http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2008/Info/experience.html</a><br /><br />Given those rankings, of our top 20 best presidents of all time, 9 of them were never governors and only 3 of them were generals.<br /><br />If the type of experience you&#39;re looking for really mattered, you&#39;d expect the presidents with governor/general/cabinet experience to dominate the top ranks and be few and far between in the lower ranks, but that isn&#39;t the case.  If the type of experience you were looking for really mattered, you&#39;d expect people like Lincoln and Kennedy to be awful presidents.  If the type of experience you were looking for really mattered, you&#39;d expect the Bush administration to be the absolute best administration by far in this country&#39;s history.<br /><br />Ultimately, the total time someone spends in office is pretty unimportant.  It is what a person does while they are in office that is important.  It is easy for most Americans to fall back on the &quot;experience is a measure of time&quot; argument because they don&#39;t care to find out what a person actually did with their time.<br /><br />[/end experience rant]<br /><br />If you want a candidate that clearly demonstrates/admits he knows absolutely nothing about any important domestic issues, vote McCain.<br /><br />If you want one of the most secretive candidates in the history of our country, vote Clinton.<br /><br />If you want a candidate that has consistently made great decisions when it came to foreign policy and social programs while simultaneously pushing some of the toughest ethics reforms in decades and whom proposes truly modern methods to create absolute transparency when it comes to campaign finances, executive orders, and federal reserve meetings, vote Obama.<br /><br />If you want a candidate that consistently demonstrates that he is intelligent enough to tackle the real issues behind our problems, address our overwhelming monetary problems, establish a sensible foreign policy that abides by the checks and balances instituted by our constitution, reinstate the civil liberties guaranteed to <i>all</i> citizens, and return the power back to the people, vote Paul.		</div>

						yeah but i might have voted for lincoln if i had heard his 4 hour debate and knew that he inspired the national dialogue on the topic.  what has obama inspired the nation to talk substantively about, what written work of his has ignited spirited debate, what legislation did he push through under tough circumstances?  overall i agree with you that experience does not dictate potential greatness and if obama becomes president then count me in the yes column of the &quot;do you agree with the job the president is doing&quot; question until he disappoints me.		</div>

If the type of experience you were looking for really mattered, you&#39;d expect people like Lincoln and Kennedy to be awful presidents. If the type of experience you were looking for really mattered, you&#39;d expect the Bush administration to be the absolute best administration by far in this country&#39;s history.</div><br /><br /><br />Normally, I agree with a good bit of what you say, Court, but that bit there didn&#39;t make sense.  14 of our best 20 presidents were either a general or governor.  (I&#39;ll assume that none were both a general and a governor)  That seems to be a pretty significant percentage when it comes to predicting if they will be a good president or not.

						Not really.<br /><br />Indeed, 18 of the top 20 presidents had executive experience (vice president, governor, general, cabinet), but 17 of the worst 20 presidents also had executive experience.  All that proves is that more people with executive experience get elected president.<br /><br />If you don&#39;t weigh VP/cabinet experience in and only include governor/general experience as valid, then it is 13 vs 10 (best vs worst).  With a sample of only 42 people, that difference of 3 people might seem compelling, but statistically it would be well within any margin of error we could come up with.  We would need to gather statistics from thousands of presidents in order to come up with any proof that executive experience affects the quality of president, but obviously we can&#39;t do that.  Until then, this information is the best representation we have of how little executive experience affects quality.		</div>

						Being a Bay Area resident, an area which has a lot of mixed races living in relative harmony, I was not as affected by it as others may have been. That&#39;s just a fault in how I was raised. There is very little (apparent) racial tension in Fremont.<br /><br />When I referred to our current candidate choices being sub-par, let me clarify that there was an inference at the end of the statement, that they are sub-par compared to Ron Paul, who I have been supporting. He was not included in my list of inferred present candidates because he&#39;s been beaten completely out of the GOP and can scarcely be considered a candidate at this point in time, though that won&#39;t stop me from voting for him in the general election if he still runs, because I will be of voting age by then.		</div>

						It was pretty apparent from her comment that even if she knew some of the rocky story she certainly wasn&#39;t &quot;familiar&quot;.<br /><br />She basically made a reference to herself as being a scrappy fighter who refuses to quit.  But not in the sense of Rocky&#39;s fighting, no, in the only scene that everyone in the universe knows... the stairs... a noble attempt at gaining some support in the city of brotherly love I guess but pretty phail.<br /><br />Plus it&#39;s pretty par for the clinton course.  Since she has no votes here I&#39;ll feel free to bash.  She&#39;s a pandering feminazi who symbolizes all that is wrong with contemporary american politics.  Almost every word that comes out of her mouth is based on some focus group finding.  Consequentially, if she&#39;s running shit you&#39;d think that would be great&#33;  right?  Somebody who does whatever the american people want?  but no.  It just makes her a liar.  <br /><br />McCain&#39;s doing well in polls?  &quot;I should appear to be a strong experienced leader&#33;&quot;  3am Commercials.<br /><br />America&#39;s not buying it? Make up some shit about &quot;leadership&quot; in the NAFTA discussions where she supported it whole heartedly, not &#39;speaking out against NAFTA, warning, &#39;this isn&#39;t going to work.&#39;&#39; as she&#39;d have us believe...<br />BONUS:  how the hell is piping up in a meeting and saying a plan that everyone agrees to won&#39;t work constitute leadership?<br /><br />Polls show that America still isn&#39;t buying it?  Tuzla-gate.<br /><br />Media proceeds to call you a liar?  Tell America that the media is a bunch of biased lying assholes.  Which they are.<br /><br />Wait for Obama to fuck up.<br /><br />Profit.<br /><br />I really want to know what she thinks her next move is... and what kind of psychosis is leading her to believe that it&#39;ll make a difference.  If she&#39;s really just relying on her opponent to make a mistake then she shouldn&#39;t be running, because basing your campaign on somebody else&#39;s credentials doesn&#39;t speak well to your ability to FUCKING LEAD.		</div>

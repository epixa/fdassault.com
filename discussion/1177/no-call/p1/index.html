						There were two obvious (to me anyhow) pass interference calls that have not been called in this game, both that should of been against the Cardinals, but this one being the major one in the game I think should have definitely been called.<br /><br />Do you think that Curtis pass was interference or not?		</div>

						give it up -- i don&#39;t want the cards representing the NFC in the superbowl either, but you shouldn&#39;t blame the game on a blown call. the eagles should have blown them out of the water but got beat by a better team that day -- quit trying to blame it on other factors.		</div>

It is the second most important game of the year, and to me it was dead on obvious that he intended to stick his arm out and grabbed Curtis. In a tight situation like that you have to call the calls that are obvious. I&#39;m not saying that is the shear reason the Eagles lost, but they could of tied the game up, and that call to me was an obvious call&#33; <br /><br />I heard a broadcaster today say &quot;You know that could of been pass interference, but let the guys celebrate.&quot; WTF is that supposed to mean, throw the game for the cardinals? Not that means anything to this discussion but I thought it was funny.<br /><br />But anyway if you think it is the reason they lost or not (let me state again I think they ruin the game in first half with the Fitzgerald coverage), alls I am asking in this thread is if you thought that should of been a pass interference call or not.		</div>

The defense fell apart, which was surprising given their season so far.  Andy Reid didn&#39;t give the ball to Westbrook enough, but maybe he was hurt worse than he was letting on.

						I don&#39;t think it was pass interference.  It was a really poor throw and there was extremely little contact.  I certainly didn&#39;t think it was &quot;dead on obvious that he intended to stick his arm out and grabbed Curtis.&quot;<br /><br />I think it was close enough that I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the call was made (this is the point the announcer was making as well), but ultimately it just didn&#39;t seem to amount to pass interference.<br /><br />That being said, I couldn&#39;t agree with Andrew more on this.  I don&#39;t understand why McNabb is even allowed to touch a football in the NFL -- he&#39;s royally fucked up every single fucking season when it counted.  I would choose a less-vetted but more consistent quarterback over his consistent inconsistency any day.		</div>

						Oh I&#39;v got more specific reasons why McNabb is to blame for this game.  He makes excellent decisions, but has a tendency to throw the ball behind the receiver on slant routes and over the receiver on go routes.  His most reliable pass is a lateral dump to Westbrook, at which point I have to ask why WB doesn&#39;t just start with the ball in the first place.  The guy plays a mean game most of the time, and next to Dawkins he&#39;s the soul of the team, but he straight lost a *Gift* championship game... against the effin&#39; cardinals...		</div>

There were a couple blown calls this season, specifically that Ed Hochilly call early on, that are causing rule reviews.  When it initially happened his explanation didn&#39;t do much to assuage the crowd, but he had an excellent point by saying he eff&#39;d up but when the ball is called dead the play is over, fumble or not, and then apologized, and was punished by the league.<br /><br />Those kinds of situations are what bring about changes like the force out rule change from this season.  Botched calls drive the game forward.		</div>

Of course they are going to talk more about issues that haven&#39;t been addressed.</div><br />A ref addressing a fuckup in-game or at a post-game press conference isn&#39;t offical, a league issued statement is. i&#39;d argue that even this doesn&#39;t quell the fans, using the ed H. example, everybody bitched about it until like week 10.		</div>

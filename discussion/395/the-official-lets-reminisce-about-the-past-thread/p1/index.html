						So, as many of you know I have the wow bug.  That being said I am in the same guild as Meadaball, Cannonfodder, and Fire from the old Tuff days.  So tonight I was in the same vent channel as most of them and found our topic of conversation to be the old counter strike days.  We went way back to the SmurF days and to the original Tuff members.  We had a ton of fun thinking up old names of people we remembered and shared interesting stories.  <br /><br />That being said, it made me miss Donut, and how it took atleast 10 minutes of constantly clicking refresh, waiting to see 15/16 slots.  I vaguely remember epic Italy battles in smurf, and pretty much idolizing the ground smurf stood on.  I was 14 at the time and so many of my friday nights were spent in these servers.  We listed a number of old names and shared some laughs about each person.  (Fishy, Aest, Barry, Green, Papa, Rafio, etc)<br /><br />So I open up the floor.  Lets remember what donut/smurf/tuff etc meant to you back when cs was fun.  I&#39;m curious what our older members have to say, just because it was so long ago, i&#39;m sure i didn&#39;t remember some of the better stories.  I wish like hell the old smurf forums could somehow be viewed.  Some incredible discussions took place, and i&#39;d be interested to see exactly how naive i was.  Everyone can post though, because we all have great stories.		</div>

						I was a few years younger when I joined Donut and began managing it, but had a blast doing so. I loved when the server was full almost all day and night, with reasonably skills people. Lets face it, those days are gone because CS isn&#39;t &quot;as&quot; popular as it once was. The thing I miss the most about FD, is the most recent stuff we did... the FD LanBQ&#39;s. It was a great gathering and I was glad to assist hosting them and had a blast at them. Met some good people in person, had great laughs, and overall enjoyed my weekends.		</div>

						My fondest memory of SmurF was the match between Delta and Omega on cs_estate.  We (Omega) practiced for like a week straight; we developed extremely precise strats for infiltrating the house, and we ended up winning 16-14.  It was actually kind of funny, we did much better on CT than we did T (I think we lost two rounds on CT).  I can&#39;t remember exactly who played on either team, but I&#39;m pretty sure omega had myself, star, jacared, jokey, and lagwagon.  It was ownage. <img src="src" alt="image" />/smile.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid=":)" border="0" alt="smile.gif" /&gt;		</div>

						When I first started playing on FD I was basically used to playing nubs on assault and had a pretty much rush and headshot everyone strategy.  The caliber of player at FD taught me that if I was going to get a better kill/death ratio I was going to have to change my tactics.  While it was still amazingly fun running around wielding a pumpy with sick boy, the competitive edge of the server is what made it special to me.		</div>

						i really enjoyed my time around the old tuff and smurf servers&#33;  competitive cs with tuff was fun too, but i wish i could have managed my time better so that i didnt have to quit.  the strongest pull for restarting was to step back into the FD server but once it lost popularity it made quitting much easier =)		</div>

						I miss italy tournament nights, hide n seek, jeepathon, and the overall diversity that was in the characters. Cal-i skill levels all the way down to negative ogl, all sorts of personalities some absolutely hilarious. I absolutely hated &quot;omega&quot;, not for the people, but for a bunch of smaller reasons. SmurF and Tuff probably shared 140+ members at least together, almost 40% having served both clans lol. Those were learning days of cs for me, true competitive play unfortunately came after clans dispersal. All the fun, ridiculousness, and insanity played out in days of SmurF, yay.<br /><br />I enjoyed the snow and original website. Greens faith in chaos, his obsession with crosseyed cadbury cats CPL, and admiral akbars exclamation of &quot;its a trap&quot;. darky&#39;s corner. papa, fishy, mant, mannam, brainy, waste, bleach, sicknam, GOV, barry, kermit, blah blah blah later stages jacared, hex, starbright, tuff members, come and go like always, neverending cycle...damn SmurF turned into such a huge community.		</div>

						LMFAO just reading this had put a smile on my face.   Where can i start?<br /><br />first of all, its absolutely an honor to see my name even mentioned in this post.  at least i know at some point in my cs career, i was a decent player.<br /><br />oh my goodness, gov, i remember that match like it happened yesterday.  omega lacked skill but we had brain.  we shouldve been cpl-i^2.  i can just imagine jacared up in everyones ear yelling strats and telling everyone how much they arent doing it as perfect as it should be done.  we raped them though.<br /><br />i remember a similar match against TuFF as well.  we won i remember and scully was really mad at us for some reason..<br /><br />i remember the completely legendary BARRY SmurF from iowa.  he was way beyond his time and went to play in cal-i for blindside with the infamous wags.  i also remember accusing barrah of indulging in too much cornography (hes from iowa).<br /><br />i also remember the LEGENDARY MIDNIGHT GAMES on hide_n_seek~&#33;&#33;  those were hands down THE BEST times EVER.  i also remember when most of the server companies banned the usuage of that map because it took up too much memory.  we had to rename the map to de_dust to throw off the server company and everyone had to redownload de_dust except it was actually hide_n_seek.  i also remember de_dust being the cal map of the week and when match time came around, most of us forgot to redownload the original de_dust and almost forfeited the match lol.<br /><br />i remember late night talks on <a rel="nofollow" href="/search?Search=%23smurf&amp;amp;Mode=like">#smurf</a> and many many pugs as well as many cal matches that were more like pugs.<br /><br />i remember the smurfettes lol, worst website ever.  so much drama with those girls and the smurfs on computers.  i never understood that.  <br /><br />i remember looking up to gov and pops and the long talks we had and i think i became an elder in the later part of smurf i dont quite recall.  it was something along those lines.  i also remember the always cool ramsey SmurF.  <br /><br />damn man, their is just too much to recall.<br /><br />I think my most memorable times in cs were matches on de_cbble.  that map is very intense and can go either way.  the strats on that map were always intricate and involved shooting through walls, the fake-fake-refake strat, and throwing the right nade to the right spot out of the hallway at the right time.<br /><br />i will always remember the old quickswitch between awp and deagle, and i will always miss being able to aim on ladders.<br /><br />all in all, it is a lot of good memories from the OLD days.<br /><br />their are just too many people to name and to even remember.  a couple of good players stick out like barrah, gov, preachah man, budd, diamondcutter dC, man|nam, green, aestivales, monk and many MANY more people i have met that were just awesome.  method, frat, flava flav (flavor country), papa, brainy, oh gosh i cant even keep thinking its just too many to list.<br /><br />i think sir (phil) is also a person that brings back funny memories.  i remember running team omega when phil had just started cs in atb.  he would talk to me and ask me to sit at our practices and spec our cal matches.  he would always ask me for pointers.  not long after, i was asking him to teach me how to play the game.<br /><br />him and gov have very little patience in regards to playing this game on a serious level.  i know that phil must have gone through several mice trying to beat this game into some of these kids heads including myself.  i could always count on phil to leave in the middle of a pug cause we were down 9-1 as t&#39;s on dust2 after winning the pistol round.  and after meeting gov, im sure he would have body slammed me during a cpl match after we rushed out of ivy on train and instead of throwing a smoke, i threw a flash and fucked everybody up.<br /><br />those were the days =).		</div>

						I voted no for the lack of a more specific polling answer.<br /><br />In my opinion, I do not believe most obese people have anything that should be construed as a disease.  I think the body is naturally inclined to eat as much as it possibly can, and I think you combine that with the most available and cheap foods in the modern world, which happen to be very high in salt and sugar, and you create a situation where people will eat far more than their bodies expected to handle.  In general, I think most cases of fat and obesity are just a result of bad luck, lack of self control, and/or lack of means to sustain a more healthy diet and activity regiment.<br /><br />I do think there are mental disorders that limit some people&#39;s ability to exercise self-control when it comes to eating, and also some conditions that decrease a person&#39;s metabolism to the point where it is extraordinarily difficult to lose weight.  I still wouldn&#39;t call obesity a disease since I think it is the consequence of other ailments in cases such as this.		</div>

						No.  Or at least no more than say, dumbness.<br /><br />You could of course have a legitimate case of dumbness.  There are numerous physiological causes for it, as well as a plethora of really great excuses.  But you could just be straight dumb.<br /><br />In that case, the dumbness isn&#39;t the disease, the disease that caused the dumbness was.  In the case of obesity, if you&#39;re fat from diabetes, then your disease is not fatness, it&#39;s the diabetes.<br /><br />But I use the definition of disease which requires it to be pathogenic or mutagenic.  So if you use the more general &quot;a condition of impaired bodily function&quot; then sure, obesity counts.		</div>

						This question made me think for a bit.<br /><br />Most of your know i&#39;m quite overweight having met me at lans.  I answered yes for one reason.  The brain.  I see obesity on the same plain as anorexia, depression or any other psychological disorder.  In simple terms, my brain doesn&#39;t work the same as others.  Food takes on an entirely different role in my life compared to that of a average sized person.  With my own personal case, i eat because it makes me feel good.  (Self-destructive)  Comparitivly, Someone who is depressed takes pills to acheieve the same results.  Eventually you get so caught up in the emotion of feeling satiated that it becomes a comfort.  <br /><br />It also is important to go into the process of weightloss.  The common response to this is: &quot;duh, cut back on what you eat,&quot; but is that really the answer?  Most obese people would tell you that losing weight is one of the hardest things imaginable, and it is.  The thought of myself becoming a normal size is completely daunting.  I know it is important for my health and other aspects of my life.  Yet, this has never helped me lose weight.  <br /><br />I believe obesity is a disease the same way alcoholism is.		</div>

						If it&#39;s a disease it should be treatable.  Or am I using to strict of a definition?<br /><br />Maybe a disorder?<br /><br />I&#39;m probably a little biased, having been treated for ADD and miserable on pills for years.  I just find it a little harder than most to accept psychological disorders as legitimate and not just behavioral anomalies.<br /><br />/not to say that psychological disorders are fake, just that my first inclination is to assume that it *isn&#39;t* an actual physiological condition in a person&#39;s brain.		</div>

						Willpower comes easy for some.  I say the lack of it might be what i&#39;m talking about.<br /><br />To further my point, i basically know how much my life would change if i lost weight.  Easier time meeting people, health, etc, etc, etc (this list really doesn&#39;t stop.)  How could improving my quality of life to such an amazing extent not serve as willpower enough to make the change?  (Rhetorical Question)  Hense by thoughts.		</div>

						It&#39;s especially apparent that it isn&#39;t simply a willpower issue when you consider other things that you may do in your life that require fairly impressive amounts of it.  Which I&#39;m sure you, as most people, do.<br /><br />Lack of willpower in one area of your life isn&#39;t indicative of a will problem.<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t classify alcoholism as a disease either.  And I don&#39;t think that detracts from the seriousness of that issue at all, just like I don&#39;t think it does the advancement of the obesity issue any disservice.<br /><br />It&#39;s like Memento:<br />&quot;There&#39;s no physical reason that Sammy shouldn&#39;t be able to form new memories.&quot;<br />Doesn&#39;t mean Sammy didn&#39;t have a real problem though...		</div>

						As an &quot;obese&quot; person I take great offense to this post.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Ok, not really. I know that I have weight issues due to my sedentary lifestyle. I have been think and in shape at different points in my life, so I know that this is a motivation issue more than  a disease per say. Do I know I need to be more active? Yes. Am I making changes in my lifestyle to do that? Yes. I think that claiming obesity as a disease is a load of crap.<br /><br />Now, the results of being obese for extended periods of time are not fake. Could those have been avoided? Yes. But often times, myself included, most people that do eat more than they should are suffering from depression, some more sever than others. Some eat out of boredom, I am guilty of that as well. These are the root issues, and there are others like this, that need to be addressed by the individual.		</div>

						You basically proved my point.  I was trying link mental health disorders with obesity.  I feel i&#39;d be hard pressed to find an obese person who didn&#39;t struggle greatly at one point in their lives leading them down a selfdestructive path.  What stable, healthy individual would eat copious amount of food knowing what will happen.  Some cut, some act out, some wallow, some eat.  Coincidence?  I think not.<br /><br />I think it also important for me to state that my thoughts on depression etc, fall under the disease category.  I&#39;m honestly not sure what a clinician would say.  I&#39;ve just seen how depression shows itself in members of my family and can&#39;t help but see a link.		</div>

						I agree with the reasons stated earlier. It simply is a lack of will and motivation to eat clean and have an active life versus being sedentary. <br /><br />There is the factor that people can be born with certain body types. Generally they are classified as Ectomorph, Endomorph, and Mesomorph. However that just gives you the basis of what your body may be shaped as (skinny, large, etc). From there you just need to build yourself correctly.		</div>

						disease:  	a disordered or incorrectly functioning organ, part, structure, or system of the body resulting from the effect of genetic or developmental errors, infection, poisons, nutritional deficiency or imbalance, toxicity, or unfavorable environmental factors; illness; sickness; ailment.<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure why this thread is about obesity, as the answer to this applies to a lot of &quot;diseases of the brain&quot;.  Some are more genetic and scientific than others.  There have been psychological tests that show that the ability to fall into an addiction (such as alcoholism) are in-part the result of genetics.  But then you run into the question of nature vs nurture, which is also relatively unknown.  <br /><br />The line for me gets drawn at whether you are able to acknowledge what you are doing or not.  I believe that bi-polar people have a disease because they aren&#39;t in control of the state of their feelings.  An alcoholic is able to think before they start drinking that &quot;I&#39;m going to get fucked up this might not be a good idea, but the hell with it I&#39;m going to do it anyways.&quot;  Same for cigarette smokers, which I happen to be.  Every time I light up, I know that I&#39;m facing myself with consequences down the road.  A bi-polar person doesn&#39;t have that before they go manic, or depressed.  A person with down syndrome doesn&#39;t have that before they pull their pants down in front of a crowd of people.  <br /><br />Claiming that you don&#39;t have enough will power doesn&#39;t cut it for me.  Will power is the result of discipline, not mental capability.  You can blame your parents for giving you bad genes.  After the age of say 16 or so, you can&#39;t really blame your parents for your lack of discipline.  <br />		</div>

Probably a lot of assumptions that you have no real basis for, except for your feelings.  Which, from here, it looks like you have no control over.  (Look out, bi-polor?)  That being said, my cousin has down syndrome...  Severe down syndrome.  He&#39;s never pulled his pants down in front of a crowd of people.  Guy&#39;s got dignity.  He&#39;s retarded as shit, half the time he barely knows what&#39;s going on.  But he composes himself.  Reacts to everything he sees with what he can.<br /><br />When I was maybe seven, or eight.  I walked up to him, and literally, asked him &quot;Are you retarded?&quot;, much as my parents had wished I hadn&#39;t, or even had specifically asked me not to.  And this guy, a few years older than me, with more decorum than most of you have when you&#39;re talking about something you actually know, nevermind talking shit like you ussually do, looked at me, and just said &quot;Yeah&quot;.<br /><br />And it wasn&#39;t some drooling answer.  He looked me in the eye, and he understood what that meant.  Reguardless of what it means, the man still makes his own decisions, and still tries to be the best man he can.  And he does a pretty fucking good job.  And he&#39;s never pulled his pants down in front of a crowd of people.		</div>

						obesity is an excuse.<br /><br />The people who have extremely low metabolism and don&#39;t do anything about it and end up they way they end up. I do agree that some people will become bigger than others eating the same amount of food as someone with a high metabolism, but they also need to take it upon themselves to do something about it rather than just blaming obesity for their troubles.		</div>

						So I just searched for honest to goodness answers on what Obesity is classified as.  <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2003-12-15-obesity-edit_x.htm" target="_blank">Found this.</a>  It pissed me off.  It is on the basis that an op ed calling for the designation of Obesity as a Disease made me angry that I formulate my opinion that it is in fact, not a disease and should never be treated as one.<br /><br />I would also think that treating the obesity, which I&#39;m inclined (for now) to believe is a symptom of a larger problem is dangerous as it avoids treating the real cause.  It&#39;s just like alcoholism.  While there are tons of anecdotal stories (some of us may even have some) of AA working wonders for people, the numbers reflect that you are just as likely to quit drinking without treatment as you are with treatment, and counseling for depression, mania, and tragedy increases those odds significantly.  I&#39;d say that treatments that specifically target the fatness of a person are probably neglecting some core problem in that person&#39;s life and might very well be leaving them with feelings of such complete powerlessness that they go right back to their vice.<br /><br />/Not sourced because I&#39;m pretty sure the pitfalls of AA and other alcoholism treatment programs are well known and well documented.		</div>

						This whole discussion reminds me of that 15 or so year old girl that tried to sue McDonalds because of her weight. The lawsuit failed (thank goodness). The funny part was I caught part of a talk show with her and her mother on it. IT WAS CLASSIC&#33; Can&#39;t remember which talkshow. It may have been Maury Povitch or something. Anyway the Host talks about the lawsuit with her and her mother a bit, how it failed. He then asks the overweight girl if she was old enough to drive. Being only 14 or 15 she said of course she couldn&#39;t drive. He responded with &quot;So your mother drove you to the McDonalds and paid for your food there? So, why don&#39;t you sue your mother?&quot; The look on the mothers face was classic. Epic Win for Host&#33;<br /><br />Very abbreviated version but hopefully you get the gist of it.		</div>

						Firstly, no. Reasons already stated.<br /><br />Second. Did you know that technically bodybuilders (the competitive ones with &lt; 4% body fat) are obese? I know we&#39;re talking about people with very high body fat percentages here but most people don&#39;t know that the &quot;scale&quot; that makes people overweight to obese doesn&#39;t take into account body fat percentage. It only takes into account height and weight. In fact, most 18-30 year old males who work out regularly and have a decently big build (for example 6&#39; 210lbs) are technically obese.		</div>

Yes they can work harder and maybe lose some fat, but they are probably never going to be skinny or what we consider to be really fit...its just the way it is.<br /><br />Some people have eating disorders...that make them want to eat all the time.

						Where is this profile you speak of?  I was unaware of any &quot;widespread&quot; requirement for disease classification.<br /><br />Anorexia and Bulimia are not the same type of thing as obesity.  Being underweight is the same type of thing as obesity, and I guarantee the 22 people that said obesity is not a disease would agree that being too thin is not a disease.  The disease is what <i>causes</i> the problem, not the problem itself.  No one of at least average intelligence will argue that there are not diseases that cause obesity, but that wasn&#39;t the question.		</div>

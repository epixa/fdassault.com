						As most of you have heard the Maersk ship the Alabama was boarded by pirates. Apparently they disabled the ship and the pirates left on the ships lifeboat. They had taken the Captain with them and left one of their own on the ship. Sounds like some kind of negotiation had taken place. Can&#39;t wait to see how this finishes up. <br /><br />What do you think? Blow the lifeboat out of the water Captain and all? Negotiate for Captains release? Or my favorite option &quot;you don&#39;t know it yet but there are 6 Navy S.E.A.L.S. under your lifeboat.&quot;		</div>

						That is <i>not</i> a viable solution.  International law <b>prohibits</b> non-military sailors from carrying guns.  Some do carry guns, but it is illegal nonetheless.  As a result, you won&#39;t find legit mercenary firms getting involved, and any individual that does arm themselves can be arrested at nearly any port they arrive in worldwide.<br /><br />As for bombing them or whatever, that&#39;s not really an option either.  As has been said, they don&#39;t have a pirate island they are hanging out on; think of pirating more like a job.  They go home to their families at the end of the night, and they are scattered throughout the civilian population.  Not only that, but the organizations are extremely lose.  You would have no more success bombing them than you would bombing Al Qaeda on the streets of Baghdad.		</div>

Something obviously has to be done for this part of the world, and as CJ said, if pirating boats started getting the shit shot out of them every time they approached a vessel, this would be dried up by now.<br /><br />The only thing allowing pirating to continue is red tape bullshit, and that&#39;s why they&#39;re laughing all the way to the bank.

They&#39;re just limited in the degree to which they can be armed. Basically meaning they&#39;re limited to small arms.

Why the fuck are boats going by this coast without serious protection on board?</div><br /><br />Have you looked at a map to realize where Somalia is located?<br /><br />Somalia is the &quot;horn&quot; of Africa. It sits alongside one of the 4 most vital shipping corridors in the world. <br /><br />The Straights of Malacca(in Indonesia, also another longstanding Piracy hot spot), Straights of Gibraltar(Mediterranean entrance to the Atlantic) , and the Straights of Hormuz(transit point between the Arabian Gulf and the Persian Gulf) being the other 3.<br /><br />You can&#39;t just simply tell international shipping to &quot;stay away&quot; from that area. The alternate route for shipping is going to be a 1,000 mile plus detour for them <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at best</span>, and could quite possibly lead them through another area that is almost as risky(the Straights of Malacca).<br /><br />You could potentially do something like the US did in the 1980&#39;s during the Iran-Iraq War and queue up civilian convoys with military escorts while they transit through the area, but you&#39;d need more than 2 warships to do that effectively given the volume of shipping passing through there(even looking at US interests alone).		</div>

Apparently the U.S. Navy is not legally allowed to blast pirates on sight. As a matter of fact since they are not terrorists nor a military the Navy is VERY limited in what they are allowed to do when they come across some confirmed pirates. I think a minor navigation error on the part of a destroyer could take care of most of the problem. Ooops Captain we seem to have struck something in the water. It&#39;s just a matter of finding them in all that open ocean.<br /><br /><br />I vote for Q-ships licensed to open fucking fire&#33;<br /><br />For those of you who do not know what a Q-ship is I shall provide a handy link.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="index.php?act=findpost&amp;pid=0"></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-ship" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-ship</a>		</div>

Though I LOVE the S.A.W. because of it&#39;s relatively light weight I would not recommend it. Go for the Browning M2 .50 caliber. Nothing says I love you like the Ma Deuce. Good penetration of light armored targets. Selective fire, semi or full auto. And a range well over 2000 meters. The S.A.W. just can&#39;t compare. Maybe use it as a mobile system aboard ship with A couple of hard mounted M2&#39;s. <br /><br /><br />Maximum effective range: 2000 meters with tripod mount<br />Maximum range: 4.22 miles (6.8 kilometers)<br /><br />		</div>

In this case I&#39;m more like 75%/25%...  We&#39;re talking about a speed boat strapped to the teeth with weapons and people coming up to your ship at high speed.  The pirates aren&#39;t just in fishing boats sailing around or something.  And a warning shot is and always has been a universal signal to turn around and/or identify yourself or risk being ripped to pieces indiscriminately.  So it&#39;s not really shooting on sight, it&#39;s shooting after a very clear warning was given and ignored.<br /><br />There is one alternative that isn&#39;t any less morally reprehensible, which is to not negotiate for anybody&#39;s life any longer.  No ransom, no money, no benefit.  They&#39;ll slow down with this stuff as it becomes less lucrative and more risky, and pretty much for no other reason.		</div>

Makes rescuing the hostages, and disabling those piracy related assets that much easier. Of course, I guess that depends on exactly how stupid the pirates are about certain things as well. <br /><br />If they do certain things, it&#39;ll make it very hard for the US Navy to do much of anything. However, most of those certain things they&#39;d have to do to thwart the US Navy if it&#39;s being clever... Are pretty much things only the US Navy does because everyone else decided its too dangerous/difficult to do. The Navy simply decided it the pay off from knowing how/being able to do it was very worthwhile from a tactical standpoint(as it makes you hard to mess with).<br /><br />Which isn&#39;t to mention the &quot;fun&quot; to potentially be had with an EMP in this situation specifically if the US was so inclined to demonstrate that the capability does exist, and that we have it in a weaponized (non-nuke) form... As this is almost shaping up to be an &quot;ideal testbed situation&quot; for them to conduct such an experiment as no truly civilian parties would be directly and negatively impacted by it(beyond the hostages, who aren&#39;t going to be terribly upset about property damage). Though the concern then becomes how the pirates would react to the electrical and electronic systems on their ships suddenly failing.		</div>

						There&#39;s a whole lot of weird flying around in this thread...<br /><br />There&#39;s a middle ground here.  Like: It&#39;s reasonable to know not to approach another vessel in open water, and quite easy to avoid.  Attacks also very rarely incur collateral damage because it&#39;s in the middle of the water.  It&#39;s less reasonable to put roadblocks up arbitrarily and use that as an excuse when people who shouldn&#39;t get shot get shot.<br /><br />I should think that being exposed to more than other people, and that changing your answer to &quot;would you shoot a 10 year old&quot; would normally be called &quot;desensitization&quot; and is generally viewed as a bad thing.  And naivety is a pejorative for &quot;compassion&quot;.  Which I&#39;d call a good thing.<br /><br />Tom&#39;s right.  As human beings we should all hate this macho bullshit attitude of &quot;guns solve the problem&#33;&quot;  Most problems have very subtle solutions and adding guns to the mix is rarely the right thing to do.  Often it escalates the problem.  What if they notice a fellow pirate ship getting the shit shot out of it?  Maybe next time they&#39;ll fire rockets from further out, or in response to the warning shot.  &quot;That&#39;ll teach these ships to fire at us&#33;  Explain 300 dead sailors to the media&#33;&quot; style.  I kind of hate when situations as nuanced as this one gets no more thought devoted to them than to come up with what kind of gun is best to mount on the ships...<br /><br />But coming up with a real fix to the problem is hard.  Maybe tolls getting paid to Somalia by ships passing through (effectively letting the pirates win) would assuage the economic troubles that foster pirating?  Things have to change for this to stop.  Look at any other desperate group of people, and the laws that do nothing to stop them.  We could round up every cartel member in South America in one afternoon, and by morning they would all have replacements.  You can&#39;t kill desperate...		</div>

						Nothing you said changes my outlook on this matter.<br /><br />Shoot back.  I&#39;m sure the pirates are watching themselves on TV (if they have one) laughing their asses off at the fact that ships keep coming to them like pigs to the slaughter and nothing can be done because of red tape bullshit.<br /><br />And don&#39;t give me the bullshit slippery slope we become what we fight argument either.  Any ship ignoring a line of .50 cal slicing across the water gets blown out of said water.  The pirates can try to shoot missiles from out of range, but good luck since for the most part they&#39;re using RPGs.<br /><br />I do not advocate violence as the answer to everything (recall my posts on the man who shotgunned down the guys robbing his neighbor), but I find people who advocate violence as the answer to NOTHING very annoying.<br /><br />This thread has gone off topic.  I stated my opinions related to a solution to THIS problem, and got attacked as if I pen the same solution to everything.  We are talking about this particular issue here, not any other.		</div>

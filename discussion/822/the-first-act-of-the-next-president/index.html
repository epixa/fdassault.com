						Out of curiosity more than anything else and regardless of which candidate is elected, what do you think should be the very first thing the next President should do upon taking office?  I&#39;m mostly interested in direct and immediate actions.<br /><br />For me, this is really hard to narrow down because I have a million and a half things that I want the next President to address, but I think I can settle on this:  Issue an executive order to remove the term &quot;enemy combatant&quot; and all of the special considerations regarding it, and clearly and unequivocally decree that all individuals in the custody of the United States should have the right to Habeas Corpus.<br /><br />Clearly we have plenty of issues that affect me far more directly than something like this, but I really don&#39;t think we are capable of making any real, long-term progress on any of the issues facing this country while we refuse to address our abuses of human and civil rights throughout the world.  Plus, it would immediately bring in a much-lacking but inherently essential oversight from the judicial branch about the legality of detainment and the preservation of what are suppose to be our god-given rights.		</div>

A defendant being found innocent doesn&#39;t mean they were innocent, it just means a jury of their peers didn&#39;t think there was undeniable proof that they were guilty.  So it means that when a large corporation spends barrels of cash to work the system in their favor (which they frequently do), then the poor guy that was justified in his lawsuit is punished.<br /><br />Or, consider the fact that even in the cases where a defendant is found not guilty, a lot of good can come from them.  The threat of lawsuit is really the only defense consumers have against corporate misdoings.  If it weren&#39;t for long-shot lawsuits, people wouldn&#39;t even know that Pacific Gas and Electric recklessly poisoned more than 1200 people because they didn&#39;t think safety was financially prudent.  What&#39;s worse: some nut job filing a frivolous lawsuit or a fatal injustice going completely unnoticed because the system was annoyed with the former nut job?<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE (Pheylan &#64; Aug 7 2008, 07&#58;13 PM) <a rel="nofollow" href="index.php?act=findpost&amp;pid=9731">&lt;{POST_SNAPBACK}&gt;</a></div><div class="quotemain">On a separate note, Court, are you referring to all people taken into custody in the US, or taken into custody all over the world?

The only realistic thing that we can do is call them common criminals and try them according to the laws of the country in which they are arrested.  The trouble with that is the vast majority aren&#39;t arrested, they are detained in the manner similar to how armies defeat armies.  There is likely little or no actual evidence gathered similar to a normal criminal investigation, so trying them in a normal court of law runs into lots of legal issues.  Do you try them and lose based on the defendant citing lack of evidence?  Then you just put them back on the street doing exactly the same thing they were doing before they were detained.  Not a very productive way to wage a war.		</div>

						We didn&#39;t invent anything.  That&#39;s the way International Law has read ever since World War I.  It&#39;s simply an area that hasn&#39;t been addressed by the UN because until this war, it wasn&#39;t an internationally recognized issue.  When the problem became apparent, the government did what they could in a difficult situation due to a lack of international systems to define what to do.

That&#39;s the way International Law has read ever since World War I.  It&#39;s simply an area that hasn&#39;t been addressed by the UN because until this war, it wasn&#39;t an internationally recognized issue.  When the problem became apparent, the government did what they could in a difficult situation due to a lack of international systems to define what to do.  The government legally couldn&#39;t consider them POW.</div><br /><br />You&#39;re right, they can&#39;t be considered POW&#39;s, however they have historically been required to see a trial before being thrown in prison.  Detaining them indefinitely or until the end of the conflict is an action taken only with POW&#39;s.  <br /><br />&quot;<b>Unlawful combatants</b> are likewise subject to capture and detention, but in addition they are subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals for acts which render their belligerency unlawful. The spy who secretly and without uniform passes the military lines of a belligerent in time of war, seeking to gather military information and communicate it to the enemy, or an <b>enemy combatant</b> who without uniform comes secretly through the lines for the purpose of waging war by destruction of life or property, are familiar examples of belligerents who are generally deemed not to be entitled to the status of prisoners of war, but to be offenders against the law of war subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals.( Emphasis added)&quot;<br /><br />But don&#39;t let facts get in the way.

Why does this top your list of priorities?  It&#39;s not the biggest drain on our budget, it&#39;s pretty well established that they aren&#39;t &quot;takin&#39; our jerbs&quot;, and the only things being smuggled in are drugs and people.  I&#39;ve never quite understood the allure of better border security with Mexico.  I think it&#39;s a waste of a lot of money.  The drugs and people will make it in anyway.  If what we&#39;ve done so far, and the risks involved with crossing the border didn&#39;t already deter them, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much we can actually do to slow the influx of illegals into the country.<br /><br />But that&#39;s just my 2cents.  So I reemphasize my question:  Why is our border with Mexico your <a rel="nofollow" href="/search?Search=%231&amp;amp;Mode=like">#1</a> priority?  (and if it isn&#39;t your <a rel="nofollow" href="/search?Search=%231&amp;amp;Mode=like">#1</a> it&#39;s clearly important enough to be the first thing the next president should handle.  Again why?)		</div>

						In all seriousness, I would like the first act of the president to be the elimination of the penny coin.<br /><br />I realize this seems frivolous, but I believe that someone who took that sort of tack on problem solving might have an actually innovative approach to politicking. What sort of mint and transactional savings would be effected by the elimination of the useless currency? What other seemingly trivial actions could lead to widespread change? Investigations of effective policy instead of interests.<br /><br />Basically, I want a president who is willing to commit political suicide in order to actually make some changes. It might be short sighted (it only takes another term to reverse it all), but it would be refreshing. Power-law based emissions programs? An honest look at our food supply and its effects on health and later healthcare? <br /><br />In either case, I probably won&#39;t even bother to vote, unless it seems there might be a chance at Obama not carrying Maryland. If the whole popular vote legislation could actually get pushed through...I might care a little more...<br /><br />Oh, and a restoration of the constitution would be a lovely thing, but since its all about interpretation...whatevs. I appreciate the people who are watchdogging our freedoms, but more people are effected by eating processed shit or breathing crappy air than being detained at Gitmo. Constitutional integrity is absolutely important...just not the top of my priority list. Guess I am more of a domestic policy person. (and no, not just fucking around with interest rates)		</div>

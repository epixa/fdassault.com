						I got banned from some terrible server for hacking like a year ago.  I think it was me and phil, maybe me and gamms, I don&#39;t remember.  We got them to unban whoever they&#39;d banned most recently repeatedly over the course of the evening while raping the everloving shit out of them.  Finally, they banned all of us.<br /><br />Instead of taking this sitting down I signed up on their forums, got the mod who banned us kicked out of his clan, the clan &quot;leader&quot; tried to get us to scrim them so they&#39;d get better, and then I never played there again.  <br /><br /><br />Bill		</div>

						I remember when I first started playing CS, I was using the T autosniper and I was hanging around in spawn  (de_dust2) and I shot into B tunnels while jumping no-scoped, I hit an admin in the face, got banned within seconds after.

						A long while back, I believe in 1.3, I was in some random server tearing it up. Server was riddled with complete nubs, and there was no challenge. They all started screaming hacker, hacker&#33;, and the admin must have come in, saw my score, and banned me.		</div>

						I&#39;ve never really liked it. <br /><br />If its coming from shitty people (Wendy) its annoying, if its coming from good people its kind of disappointing (since hacking is the lowest of the low and I&#39;d much rather get credit for being a good player from some one who themselves is a good player). It was worst when I had my own server and it came from the regs there, no one wants to play on a server that is owned by a hacker (I remember playing really well against the first guy that came into my server and he told me &quot;go fuck your mother, hacking noob&quot;.		</div>

						When I just got accused I&#39;d tell &#39;em to spec me and submit it to forums or find an admin.  If I got banned from a random server I said fuck it most of the time, but there were always the scoutzknivez servers which I was into for a while which would ban me every now and again.  Most servers it&#39;s just a matter of going on forums and asking if there was a demo.  Which there never is.<br /><br />		</div>

They&#39;ve all quit, and there were 3 players that carried that team, 1 yourself who played very very little, 2 myself 3 GnS. Every other person was terrible you know it and I know it mungo knows it, they can run their mouth all they wanted that was the fact. I was consistant until I burnt out, the game got old and i just didn&#39;t care to practice. <br />I was just as much of a dick when I approached the topic so for that i&#39;m sorry but that&#39;s how i feel sucks we don&#39;t play anymore but it sucks that i found out you cheated because that was a slap in the face to me.		</div>

						Yea, last I knew, if you even hinted at something like you said Retro, it would be a ban.<br /><br /><br /><br />No one here gives a shit what someone&#39;s skin color is. If you are going to insult Scab, at least do it intelligently. You can eat shit and die for all I care. I WILL not be associated with someone like that. I think you might want to apologize, and perhaps take a break in posting. If it were up to me, you would be taking a break, whether you want to or not.<br /><br />Don&#39;t ever insult someone because of their skin color.		</div>

He was, like many other people on this crazy world wide web, probably just trying to derail what was becoming a near-belligerent, worthless conversation.

Heard some self-righteous prick was being racist to a guy that&#39;s been around FD for quite a long time.<br /><br />It&#39;s amazing still what people will say over the internet.  Where I come from, retr0, making a remark like that would warrant a well-deserved ass-wooping.  Perhaps a day will come where you smart off like that to the wrong person, in person, and have said ass-wooping happen.

						All racism aside, by citing that quote, you demonstrate a clear lack of understanding of how to evaluate statistics.  A general statistic like that will have numerous (this particular statistic is sociological in nature, so it is probably more like &quot;countless&quot;) affecting agents such as location, type of education, environmental influences, and even social stimulations.<br /><br />More white people play in the NHL than black people, but that doesn&#39;t make you a professional hockey player anymore than Richie&#39;s ethnicity makes him illiterate.		</div>

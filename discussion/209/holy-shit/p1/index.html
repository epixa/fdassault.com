						I was on my way home from school to hang out with some of my friends. About half way there (I was dipping) I leaned over to drink some water and my right tires hit the gravel on the country road, since I was going 80 I lost control of my car instantly and did a 360. I went across the other lane and into a ditch and finally stopping in a corn field. not until i got out did I realize just how lucky I was... not even 2 feet from where my tires tracks were was a telephone pole. And somehow my car didn&#39;t flip... the boys who designed the toyota solara deserve a raise for that small miracle&#33;<br /><br />Everyone has experienced a similar and probably worse automobile story... share you &quot;HOLY SHIT&#33;&quot; story&#33;		</div>

						1.  Driving on the highway.  This is back in highschool and i had only been driving for a few months.  This was the farthest I had driven before and I was with my girlfriend.  There were several signs saying...caution slow down, turn.........for an off ramp deal.   You know how it is, usually it says you need to go like 25 miles per hour or something, when really you can go like 40 or 50.  Well...this time it really meant it.  My girlfriend was distracting me, and before I knew it i was going to hit a barrier, so i turn it hard..do a little more than a 360, and end up in the middle of the road.  Mac truck behind me stops within an inch of me.  My gf was pissed.<br /><br />2.  driving on the back roads.  It was winter but no snow yet.  I go on this road all the time so I am going really fast..for some reason, there was a patch of ice and snow in a line, right where my tire was when I went over a hill.  I go sliding off the road...on the right there is a ditch, on the left there is a brick wall..skinny road.  I swirv left swirv, right, almost hit the damn brick wall, but end up doing a 180, and stop in the correct lane.  Look over to my friend, we just sit there for a sec, he says &quot;well done&quot; and I say &quot;yup&quot; and we drive off lol.<br /><br /><br />		</div>

						See - I had the opposite thing happen.  I lost control going around a corner on some black ice; fish tailed and went flying off the road sideways and hit the only fucking tree within 100 feet.  Of course, I was doing like 30 on the road and maybe 15 when I hit the tree (Sideways through a foot of snow is great for slowing down).<br /><br />Maybe I&#39;m retarded but what did you mean by &quot;(I was dipping)&quot;?		</div>

Afterwards we decided to pick up a movie and watch it at someone&#39;s house. On our way to the house one of the guys in the other car calls me saying he didn&#39;t have any money, well the person in my passenger seat did have money so we decided to hand off money between the cars going down the road. We were going 60-65, was the start of winter, and we were about a foot away from each other handing money from my passenger seat to the other cars backseat. I wasn&#39;t looking at the road too much because I was seeing how much closer I had to get to the other car, and wound up driving the other car into the shoulder.<br /><br />It was fun.		</div>

						Well, one of the first time I went driving with our car here ( a Toyota Sienna ), my father in law told me to go back so I let the car go back alone, and then it blocks on the grass, he tells me to press the pedal but the other car I had driven was a Toyota Echo and it&#39;s so freaking weak, I press the pedal like I would with the Echo but I go hit a little bit in the tree because the powr is like 10 times stronger, so yeah that&#39;s not a HOLY SHIT but still it got me mad.		</div>

In fact, the only way he would be<br />spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia stuck their heads out<br />of the living-room window and looked straight down into the flowerbed<br />below.

						homeboi was driving my car one day. I was in the passenger side. it had just got done raining. we were driving through this curvy ass back country road. hard to explain but the road was lower than the surroundings. kinda like small cliffs on either side. deep in the forest as well. he hit a super curb going around 60. lost control. I remember seeing the dirt from the side of the road coming straight at me. if we had gone straight into it we would have died instantly. instead, for some crazy the front of the car bounced up and we went up the fucking wall instead. this caused us to go airborne. I then remember counting each flip we did. 3 total. the car landed upside down. then caught on fire. my seatbelt was jammed. I somehow untangled myself from it and crawled through a little opening where the side door and window had been. when I looked back at the car I don&#39;t see how my head didn&#39;t get crushed in because the roof of the car was basically where the dashboard should be. the car was totaled. every tire was flat and the rims bent in sideways. The only injury I had was scrapes and cuts and fragments of glass and debris in my arms.		</div>

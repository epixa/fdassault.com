						Believe me, I couldn&#39;t give two shits about such news other than the fact my 76 year old grandfather, with whom i&#39;ve shared many of heated political dicussions recently thinks it is gigantic news.  Did i mention he is hardcore republican and watching Bill O&#39;reilly is a fair substitution to Sunday morning Church?<br /><br />For the first time EVER, my grandfather spoke of Barack Obama with an ounce of dignity.  This is huge as his prefered term to anything democrat is &quot;hippie&quot;.  Apparently children out of wedlock is a hot item for his kind.<br /><br />Anyone else have a comparable experience and/or forsee any Mccain/Palin ramifications?		</div>

A politician&#39;s family life very much does impact the qualities of their person.  Her kid getting pregnant can be seen as a consequence of bad parenting.  Obviously that is a debatable subject, but that doesn&#39;t mean it shouldn&#39;t be discussed.  And obviously her kid&#39;s (or hers, we&#39;ll probably never know) choice to keep the baby is a big deal to a lot of people out there.  I, for one, think it shows just how irresponsible her social philosophy is, and I have no problem discussing that in any detail.<br /><br />If a politician is going to cite their personal life as part of their experience, then that personal life should be open to just as much scrutiny as their political career.  If they use their kid&#39;s unfortunate circumstance to help solidify a social stance, then that also should be up for criticism.		</div>

A politician&#39;s family life very much does impact the qualities of their person.  Her kid getting pregnant can be seen as a consequence of bad parenting.  Obviously that is a debatable subject, but that doesn&#39;t mean it shouldn&#39;t be discussed.  And obviously her kid&#39;s (or hers, we&#39;ll probably never know) choice to keep the baby is a big deal to a lot of people out there.  I, for one, think it shows just how irresponsible her social philosophy is, and I have no problem discussing that in any detail.<br /><br />If a politician is going to cite their personal life as part of their experience, then that personal life should be open to just as much scrutiny as their political career.  If they use their kid&#39;s unfortunate circumstance to help solidify a social stance, then that also should be up for criticism.</div><br /><br />Okay.  There&#39;s a REALLY fine line there.  I&#39;m inclined to agree that she opened herself, and her children up to some scrutiny by being a candidate running on family values.  But seriously, her kids?<br /><br />Meanwhile, while the McCain camp claimed that she was thoroughly vetted as a VP, and that they went to the FBI to investigate her, they apparently have just come out and said that they used Google, and read local news.  The FBI says that they don&#39;t vet candidates EVER.  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/07/obamas_veep_vetting_enters_new.html" target="_blank">This is Obama&#39;s vetting process</a>.<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the choice was made to try and take the wind out of Obama&#39;s post convention sails, with the intention of having her step down to deal with family matters, like her retarded baby and soon to be grandmother-ness, and Lieberman or Romney get chosen.		</div>

						While most of us here may argue our points until someone gets angry enough to say &quot;I quit&quot;, I won&#39;t even bother. I stated what I thought, and apparently, like I expected, no one seemed to notice it. Unless you count Jimmah&#39;s post, but that is irrelevant. Why are we focusing on her family life, when, it is her issues and her past voting we should be talking about? Sure, family can affect something this big, but honestly? If McCain/Palin lose this election, it won&#39;t be because of her daughter. It will be because of their lack of popularity. Most likely though, it will be because people are fed up with the Republicans and how they have been handling the past 8 years while having control of the Presidency. Which, I guess can be grouped in with they lack of popularity. If they win, then hell, good for them. If they lose, no one should blame it on her daughters situation and whether or not her daughter will keep it or not.		</div>

						@ xemplar anyway, cause I feel bad:<br />In addition to what Court&#39;s saying, I think it&#39;s important to note what makes this election different than those in recent memory.<br /><br />Republicans like fiscally, socially, and otherwise conservative.  Our recent republican leadership has abandoned many republican ideals in favor of courting a much more religious, and much more fascist right.  So yeah, the brand is in trouble.  Meanwhile, McCain, painted as a maverick for decades, and for the most part, rightfully so, is able to rebuild respect for the label.  I think a lot of republicans are extremely disappointed in what their party has become and yet they linger on the hope that the days of competent leadership with moral fiber and intellect can come back.  Many.  Manymanymany will pull the lever for McCain no matter what.<br /><br />Democrats have been really loud for the past 8 years.  It&#39;s how we have a democratic majority for the first time in a decade.  They maintain their fervor now and it really energizes the base to keep hope alive.  Blah blah.  Black man comes on the stage.  Drama.  Intrigue.  The base explodes.  You have young people signing up in record numbers across the nation.  You have black people registering like a motherfucker.  So their base&#39;s demographic is much different.  Single issue voters don&#39;t matter so much to the Dems.<br /><br />There are the mythical Clintonians, who may refuse to pull the lever for Obama, or may outright pull it for McCain.  We aren&#39;t yet sure of the effects of his VP choice, or if that choice will survive the Convention.<br /><br />My point is this.<br /><br />Many people who were stalwart voters in every election in recent memory.  The core demographics of each party I mean, may not vote at all, and there are many new voters, who could vote en force, or do the usual and stay at home.<br /><br />This election&#39;s different.		</div>

						I even called my mother to ask her if i&#39;m being sexist, and she said &quot;no&quot;, &quot;she has a great deal of responsibility as a mother with a pregnant daughter and a special needs child&quot;.   Parenting is a responsibility plain and simple.  Adding to those responsibities are the fact she now must support a daughter and grand daughter for an extended period time, this is assuming her daughter does the right thing and raises the child, forgoing higher education, and financial security on her own.  The father sure sounds like a winner and considering he&#39;ll &quot;hurt anyone who gets in his face&quot;.<br /><br />I really wasn&#39;t trying to be sexist, but i can see how it might be.  Bottom line though, parenting can&#39;t be overlooked as a complication to politics on bother sides on the ticket.  <br /><br />Any idea what Levi Johnson&#39;s age is?  I&#39;m just curious.  My mother added that he refused to marry Bristol Palin, and has no intention of raising said child.<br /><br />LOL @ your post coffee.  I love it too&#33;		</div>

						And Mary, Jesus mother was a pregnant virgin.<br /><br />You&#39;re 18, and you fuck the governor&#39;s daughter.  She finds out she&#39;s preggers.  5 months later when she&#39;s starting to show it, you finally get the balls to go to your parents.  You say you wouldn&#39;t have been fucking if you didn&#39;t plan on getting married because that would be wrong.  You don&#39;t say, &quot;Well we were just fucking around and I didn&#39;t pull out... I guess I&#39;ll marry her though.&quot;<br /><br />It&#39;s the same as any high school pregnancy, and there&#39;s upwards of an 85% chance that it will end in disaster if it&#39;s like every other marriage borne of an unexpected pregnancy.<br /><br />Also.  The pressure to wed has been placed on those kids since they were old enough to understand words.  Palin&#39;s extremely religious and fully subscribes to some of the crazier fundamentalist beliefs regarding sex and sexuality.  I don&#39;t think these kids grew up in a bubble... They are probably scared shitless and now the whole country knows that Bristol Palin is easy, and Levi Johnson doesn&#39;t wrap his tool.  I find the fact that Camp D is using this information to slam Palin and McCain abhorrent, and I find it equally reprehensible, if not slightly moreso, that Camp R is using this information to court the religious right.  One of them is sort of a tit-for-tat response.  The other is shameless exploitation.		</div>

						I don&#39;t think it is abhorrent at all that people are citing this in the political race.  If I raised five awesome kids that went on to lead extremely successful lives, I would expect people to think good of me for it.  If I raised five awful kids, I&#39;d expect people to think poor of me for it.  Being a shitty parent shows that you don&#39;t understand people very well and you have poor judgment, and I think a good understanding of people and sound judgment are two of the fundamental traits of a good politician (in the sense that this politician &quot;does good things for their country&quot; as opposed to the more common &quot;does things that improve their own chances for more income, power, and influence&quot;).		</div>

						The word you&#39;re looking for is &quot;neoconservative&quot; or, as I have begun to call them, &quot;anti-conservatives&quot;.<br /><br />Don&#39;t get me wrong.  I think it is reasonable to talk about a politician&#39;s personal life when it is related to their abilities as a leader, but I think there are also far more important things to discuss besides that.  The number of issues that you just joked about are a good examples of more important issues.		</div>

						she&#39;d have to have 3/5, 4/5 or 5/5 bad children for me to consider her a bad parent.  you can be the best parent in the world and your kid might turn out differently than you had planned - ie he isn&#39;t social even though you taught him to be simply because he has the gene for depression/anxiety; ie he is wild because he wants to experience things for himself even though you taught him not to and set a good example.  plus i really dont see this as showing that her kid is &#39;bad&#39;, as mistakes happen and dealing with them can illustrate character.  a bad kid is probably one that does not live up to their potential... and of course bad choices like having a baby at a young age could damage one&#39;s potential, but such bad choices are not insurmountable.<br />		</div>

						That&#39;s all well and good, but it isn&#39;t really a rebuttal of my point.  I wasn&#39;t trying to say she is or is not a good parent, but rather that the quality of a politician&#39;s personal life should be open to discussion just like everything else they do.  If it happens to involve their kids, well that sucks...but that&#39;s not the public&#39;s problem.<br /><br />Although since you brought it up, I think she&#39;s an <i>awful</i> parent.		</div>

That is the most ignorant post I&#39;ve ever seen. The whole percentage is bullshit as well. Many do fail, you are right on in that point. Though, 85%? To give an example, my uncle got my aunt pregnant when she was 16/17, they are now in their mid 40&#39;s with 2 additional kids. I may be a bit biased, but I call bullshit on your part about teens and failed marriages. My Aunt/Uncle may be a &quot;rare&quot; story, but is factual. If the teen marriage divorce rate is 85, please, show me a link that says that. I couldn&#39;t find anything like that.		</div>

						16/17 year olds are not mentally ready to make the leap into marriage.  While 85% MIGHT be a slight exageration, considering we currently have a 40-50% divorce rate among ADULTS, would prove 85% is probably not far away from the correct percentage.<br /><br />I also read an article about Palin stating that she cut &#36;1.1 mil from a &#36;4 mil act providing unwed teen age mom&#39;s with the support and skills needed to manage the responsibility.

Keep spinning though.<br /><br />Also.  Anecdotal evidence is anecdotal.  And hyperbole isn&#39;t meant to be taken seriously.<br /><br />She has more like a 27% chance of getting a divorce in the next 5 years.  Which is higher than most other age groups (except boomers interestingly, but give our generation time... we&#39;ll work up there)  But if you count the bible-belt style of her upbringing she&#39;s actually at higher risk for divorce than even them.  30-40%.  Not 85%, but the point remains.<br /><br />Seriously though, good for your Aunt and Uncle.  They are an exception to the rule, and a testament to their resolve and level headedness.		</div>

If I raised five awesome kids that went on to lead extremely successful lives, I would expect people to think good of me for it.  If I raised five awful kids, I&#39;d expect people to think poor of me for it.  Being a shitty parent shows that you don&#39;t understand people very well and you have poor judgment, and I think a good understanding of people and sound judgment are two of the fundamental traits of a good politician (in the sense that this politician &quot;does good things for their country&quot; as opposed to the more common &quot;does things that improve their own chances for more income, power, and influence&quot;).</div><br /><br />Do you really think that is a decent argument?  This is just like Hannity saying that if Edwards can&#39;t keep a commitment to his wife, how could we ever expect him to keep a commitment to his country.  Following that logic, Clinton should have been a terrible president.  He wasn&#39;t a terrible president.  He did a pretty good job.<br /><br />Personal issues don&#39;t always get in the way of a person&#39;s ability to govern.  It&#39;s not fair to judge the parents for the child&#39;s crimes.  Today there are so many people that blame their parents for their actions.  There is no problem in blaming parents for how they treat their children, but the children decide how to act on their own (except in some really weird, bizarre cases).  Judge people by their actions, not the actions of the people around them.  Should we go back to discussing Obama&#39;s association with <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Ayers" target="_blank">William Ayers</a> or <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Wright" target="_blank">Jeremiah Wright</a>?  I thought both were irrelevant then, as I think this is irrelevant now.<br /><br />We don&#39;t even know if the child has the same ideology of the mother, and if she doesn&#39;t, would we expect her to follow it?  Can any of us here say that we didn&#39;t do anything that our parents wouldn&#39;t approve of?		</div>

						This is certainly more relevent than Obama serving on a board with Ayers, or having an attention whore pastor.  But it&#39;s still not the best thing to focus on.		</div>

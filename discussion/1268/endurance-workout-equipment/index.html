						To those exercising folk out there: what type of workout equipment do you think is the best option for aerobic/endurance exercise?  To me, the obvious choices are a stationary bike or a treadmill.  If I&#39;m not mistaken, the bike is best on your knees and such but takes a lot longer than running on a treadmill?		</div>

						Swimming is without the doubt the best for your overall body coverage and damage. But assuming you&#39;re talking about something you can buy and do at home, a step climber is excellent. (Or you can just run up and down the stairs and try not to injure yourself) The problem is that a good step climber will cost you, and cheaps are just that, cheap.		</div>

Will cost you less than &#36;100 and you will be stronger than running/biking/elliptical but with the same endurance capacity. Takes of less room too.</div><br /><br />Phil, was the suggestion of 35lb based on what you think Court&#39;s strength and fitness level could handle, or is that a general suggestion for the weight any of us should use?  What about the number of reps?  Is there a certain max or min time limit?<br /><br />I&#39;m asking because I&#39;m thinking about picking up 1 or 2 (probably 1 because they&#39;re expensive as shit) kettlebells to help build my shoulder endurance.  <br /><br />There&#39;s one evolution in BUD/S and Hellweek called Log PT and it has one of the highest drop on request rates.  Recruits are grouped into boat crews of 5-7 guys and have to haul a giant log around to do multiple exercises with it for like 2 hours straight. Also, there&#39;s a lot of work done with the small inflatable boats.  Pushing them up over your head, running between evolutions with them on your head, lifting and setting them down over and over.  Obviously more than just shoulders get worked out, but I already work out most of my body plenty during the week.  Lately with all my calisthenics, running and swimming I seem to be neglecting my shoulders.  The individual load on each man during these evolutions isn&#39;t that much, right around 30lbs or so, but the fact that it lasts for hours really pushes you to your limits.  <br /><br />Throwing in some KB snatch workouts during the week, or any other work with the KB that would help with shoulder endurance, seems like a good idea to me.<br /><br />How often do you use the KB?  What kind of exercises can you do with the KB?  Which ones would you suggest for someone looking to work on shoulder endurance?  What weight or weights would you suggest me purchasing?  <br /><br /><br />Sorry to hijack your thread Court, but i think your question has been answered anyway.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />PS.  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Kettlebells-35-lb-16-kg-russian-kettlebell-crossfit_W0QQitemZ200326850842QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item200326850842&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&amp;_trkparms=66%3A4|65%3A15|39%3A1|240%3A1307" target="_blank">35lb Kettlebell on ebay for &#36;63 including shipping.</a>		</div>

To me, the obvious choices are a stationary bike or a treadmill.  If I&#39;m not mistaken, the bike is best on your knees and such but takes a lot longer than running on a treadmill?</div><br /><br />As much as I like to cycle...sationary bikes are pretty boring, and you are right you need to do it a lot longer.  I don&#39;t mind stationary bikes when you are on rollers, as it feels a lot more like riding but those still kinda suck as well.  (Riding outside is a whole different story as it is actually fun).  <br /><br />Elipticals just feel really weird to me, and I don&#39;t feel like I am getting as much as a cardio workout<br /><br />I would go for running.<br /><br />a lot of personal preference here tho obviously.		</div>

						<div class="quotetop">QUOTE (CJ. &#64; Apr 8 2009, 07&#58;05 AM) <a rel="nofollow" href="index.php?act=findpost&amp;pid=15332">&lt;{POST_SNAPBACK}&gt;</a></div><div class="quotemain">Phil, was the suggestion of 35lb based on what you think Court&#39;s strength and fitness level could handle, or is that a general suggestion for the weight any of us should use?  What about the number of reps?  Is there a certain max or min time limit?<br /><br />I&#39;m asking because I&#39;m thinking about picking up 1 or 2 (probably 1 because they&#39;re expensive as shit) kettlebells to help build my shoulder endurance.  <br /><br />There&#39;s one evolution in BUD/S and Hellweek called Log PT and it has one of the highest drop on request rates.  Recruits are grouped into boat crews of 5-7 guys and have to haul a giant log around to do multiple exercises with it for like 2 hours straight. Also, there&#39;s a lot of work done with the small inflatable boats.  Pushing them up over your head, running between evolutions with them on your head, lifting and setting them down over and over.  Obviously more than just shoulders get worked out, but I already work out most of my body plenty during the week.  Lately with all my calisthenics, running and swimming I seem to be neglecting my shoulders.  The individual load on each man during these evolutions isn&#39;t that much, right around 30lbs or so, but the fact that it lasts for hours really pushes you to your limits.  <br /><br />Throwing in some KB snatch workouts during the week, or any other work with the KB that would help with shoulder endurance, seems like a good idea to me.<br /><br />How often do you use the KB?  What kind of exercises can you do with the KB?  Which ones would you suggest for someone looking to work on shoulder endurance?  What weight or weights would you suggest me purchasing?  <br /><br /><br />Sorry to hijack your thread Court, but i think your question has been answered anyway.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />PS.  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Kettlebells-35-lb-16-kg-russian-kettlebell-crossfit_W0QQitemZ200326850842QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item200326850842&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&amp;_trkparms=66%3A4|65%3A15|39%3A1|240%3A1307" target="_blank">35lb Kettlebell on ebay for &#36;63 including shipping.</a></div><br /><br /><br />Lots of questions there CJ&#33;<br /><br />I answered court&#39;s question based on his desire for endurance work, plus my personal belief that you need some strength or strength-endurance work to achieve useful fitness. 35lbs is a good weight for anyone who isnt already in good shape to start with, for a KB. Someone who is already pretty strong can start with 44 or 53lbs. However for endurance the 35lb is always useful, if we&#39;re talking about long sessions. The standard is the Secret Service Snatch Test. Its very simple. snatch the KB as many times as you can in 10 mins. However, to me endurance means longer than 10 mins. As you noted with Log PT, 2-3 hours is quite normal for military prep. But since Court is not a longtime lifter, 35lbs would allow him to get stronger and then move into the endurance work fairly quickly as he adapts. After talking to him some more I made some differing recommendations.<br /><br />Now for you...you&#39;re looking at some serious asskicking in BUDS. I&#39;ve only ever worked out with 1 SEAL and he was a total badass. My sister has been to Pendleton to train and reports that its pretty amazing what goes on there.<br /><br />Right now you are mostly running, swimming and doing calthistentics right? So push-ups and pull-ups. But military work requires that you carry a bunch of shit. 50lbs of gear, ruck marches, log carrying, dragging ammo boxes, etc. <br /><br />First to answer your direction questions to me, then to make my recommendations for you. I workout with my KB maybe 3x a week at the moment. I like to keep things varied, but have torn some ligaments in my ankle and am swamped in schoolwork, so my workout ethic has been poor the last few weeks. So don&#39;t go by my standards&#33; I do all manner of exercises with said kettlebell, because its all i have right now, aside from my bodyweight. I squat with it, snatch it, clean it, press it, swing it, and deadlift it. Its a 53lber, because Bill borrowed my 35lber like 2 years ago and I have yet to recover it. Currently I have been working toward being able to press the KB 5x with each arm. 4 on the right and 3 on the left. But my exercises are mostly maintenance while i heal my ankle and finish out this semester of school. <br /><br />Now. for your situation. What do you have? What do you do. As a basic recommendation I would suggest you do some carrying work. Think strongman. Find a log, or rock, or sandbag or kettlebell that weights 35-75 lbs and start carrying it for time or distance. Carrying big assed weight is a good way to work your general capacity to do shit. The sandbag mile is a good challenge. Goal: to carry half you BW 1 mile in under 20 mins, structure your training as needed. <br /><br />Also, you dont actually need a kettlebell. They&#39;re pricey (but can be found at Play It Again for pretty cheap). Dumbbells work well. But like I said in Gachi&#39;s thread, get your ass into some sort of functional movement program ASAP. Sounds like you&#39;re already doing stuff, just make sure you don&#39;t neglect absolute strength. How&#39;s your deadlift?		</div>

While you may be muscular, your strength could be in the shitter, especially after not touching any weights for 2 months. Because you&#39;ll be working with said log for 2-3 hours for your BUDS test or what not, I suggest you start deadlifting and pressing, but concentrate on form. Working with that log for 2-3 hours will probably put you to complete exhaustion, but you can definitely save a great deal of energy if your form is on point. Towards the end of the log work, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be too tired to even think, but if you ingrain proper form there will be little possibility of injury as well.		</div>

While you may be muscular, your strength could be in the shitter, especially after not touching any weights for 2 months. Because you&#39;ll be working with said log for 2-3 hours for your BUDS test or what not, I suggest you start deadlifting and pressing, but concentrate on form. Working with that log for 2-3 hours will probably put you to complete exhaustion, but you can definitely save a great deal of energy if your form is on point. Towards the end of the log work, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be too tired to even think, but if you ingrain proper form there will be little possibility of injury as well.</div><br /><br />Well I&#39;ve always been the type of person to stress perfect form in the gym, so I&#39;m not too worried about that.  I definitely see what you&#39;re saying though.  That&#39;s part of the reason I inquired about the kettlebell and the way I could use it to build strength in my shoulders and core.  <br /><br />I&#39;m not sure how i feel about your declaration that strength and muscle mass are two completely different things.  This goes against every ounce of logic and reasoning in my body.  Can you maybe elaborate?  Does anyone else agree disagree with this statement?<br /><br />As you gain strength you increase the number of muscle fibers, increasing your muscle size or mass.  Someone who has larger muscles will be stronger, provided they have the same muscle density, i suppose.  So I guess it&#39;s someone who has larger OR heavier muscle will be stronger.  Idk, I&#39;m not an expert but this is something i&#39;ve never really questioned or heard the opposite said about.  Am I wrong?  I could see maybe saying that strength and muscle mass aren&#39;t the exact same thing, but to say they are completely different things seems off to me.		</div>

That all depends on how coarse or fine the sand is, doesn&#39;t it?</div><br />Surprisingly very little.  If the sand is coarse then each grain takes up a bigger volume and that seems to be proportional enough to not matter.  I suspect that sand so fine it is effectively dust would simply pack tighter and lead to a heavier bag, but the minute differences in sand coarseness don&#39;t seem to have much of a recorded effect at all.<br /><br />Sand, wet --------------- 1922 kg/m<sup>3</sup><br />Sand, wet, packed ----- 2082 kg/m<sup>3</sup><br />Sand, dry --------------- 1602 kg/m<sup>3</sup><br />Sand, loose ------------- 1442 kg/m<sup>3</sup><br />Sand, rammed --------- 1682 kg/m<sup>3</sup><br />Sand, water filled ------ 1922 kg/m<sup>3</sup><br />Sand with Gravel, dry - 1650 kg/m<sup>3</sup><br />Sand with Gravel, wet - 2020 kg/m<sup>3</sup><br /><br />Even if the sand has gravel in it, the density doesn&#39;t really change THAT much.<br /><br />Fill a fucking bag with sand.  If it&#39;s too heavy, let some out.  If it&#39;s not heavy enough stick it underwater before you go for a jog. <br />/cock.<br /><br />edit: in theory, I&#39;d suspect that the increase in grain size is relatively correspondent to the increase in mass such that the density remains the same.  Sand has a tendency to close-pack when compacted, so the difference between 3 fine grains of sand and 1 large grain of sand is probably a 100th of a mL worth of plain air.<br />		</div>

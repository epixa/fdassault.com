						My college starting tonight is banning smoking on campus.  The school is getting money from Pennsylvania by doing this. The finds that they are saying they are going to give out if someone breaks this ban is &#36;250.  I don&#39;t smoke, but I do find this kind of ridiculous and I know there are going to be plenty of protests tomorrow all over the place.<br /><br />What do you guys think of this situation?		</div>

						Also I remember switching colleges being a HUGE pain in my ass.  Couple that with the INSANE budgets colleges work with compared to how much they spend per student, and you&#39;re looking at the most ineffectual boycott ever at a very high cost to you.<br /><br />I suggest protests, petitions, letters to the dean, and getting some fall guys to smoke all over campus anyway.  Non-students in the area may be coerced into flagrantly violating the schools ban and laughing in police officer&#39;s faces when they try to enforce it.		</div>

						I agree that this could be a slippery slope for the government but only because the government only cites the constitution when they think it helps their point (you can blame anyone that voted for Obama/McCain for helping to promote that, by the way), and I&#39;m all for cutting back on government control over unnecessary things, but I do believe this issue is entirely a constitutional argument and therefore very necessary.  Don&#39;t get me wrong; I could care less about someone smoking on the street.  However, if second-hand smoke does, in fact, kill people, then I think it is our constitutional duty to stop it from happening.		</div>

						imo one of the main problems in this whole issue is that second hand smoke &quot;kills&quot;. yes it is detrimental to your health, albeit in  obscenely large concentrations for long periods of time. A direct correlation is weak at best because of the numerous controls you can have in your study. Take the empirical evidence of the mean age when smokers are diagnosed with lung cancer. Statistical biases and external factors aside, even the heaviest smokers (2-3 packs/day) tend to be diagnosed many, many years down the road from when they actually started inhaling vast quantities of carcinogens. Sniffing SHS for a few seconds in your day won&#39;t kill you, it likely won&#39;t affect you at all, unless you have a pre-existing health issue, in which case smoking is already restricted in most public places.<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Next will be smoking in your car because it can affect your passenger(s) or children.</div><br /><br />Okotoks, a town a few hours from where I live, has already done this <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=210bfce4-769e-44be-a084-0ec7374e9fa7" target="_blank">http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/s...84-0ec7374e9fa7</a>		</div>

Not on the general premise, of which you&#39;ve made an accurate assessment, but rather on the effective result.  If I want a cigarette I&#39;m now confined to my home.  That&#39;s it.  That&#39;s your only option.  Since this is a college, you can&#39;t smoke in the dorms.  So basically the college has completely banned (or prohibited) the use of tobacco anywhere on campus.  Not in a bar, not in your home, not on the street.  That&#39;s prohibition IMO and isn&#39;t designed to protect anyone so much as it was to inflate the schools numbers of non-smoking students.<br /><br />If this were a small town, I&#39;d be cool with it.  Especially since there&#39;s a town hall you could go to to hash it out.  But at a college where you have absolutely no say as a student in their policy, this is absolutely analogous to the prohibitions of yesteryear.		</div>

Not on the general premise, of which you&#39;ve made an accurate assessment, but rather on the effective result.  If I want a cigarette I&#39;m now confined to my home.  That&#39;s it.  That&#39;s your only option.  Since this is a college, you can&#39;t smoke in the dorms.  So basically the college has completely banned (or prohibited) the use of tobacco anywhere on campus.  Not in a bar, not in your home, not on the street.  That&#39;s prohibition IMO and isn&#39;t designed to protect anyone so much as it was to inflate the schools numbers of non-smoking students.<br /><br />If this were a small town, I&#39;d be cool with it.  Especially since there&#39;s a town hall you could go to to hash it out.  But at a college where you have absolutely no say as a student in their policy, this is absolutely analogous to the prohibitions of yesteryear.</div><br /><br />The reason this is acceptable on a campus is that there are no private residences.  A dorm room provides privacy, but it isn&#39;t your residence.  You don&#39;t rent it, nor do you own it.  Instead, you&#39;re basically a guest in the college&#39;s house.  If you were staying at a buddy&#39;s place that asked you not to smoke in his guest room, I doubt you&#39;d think that is weird or wrong at all.  More than anything though, smoking is banned in dorms not because of second-hand smoke but to prevent property damage, so that is entirely besides the point.<br /><br />Blanket bans on something like smoking aren&#39;t really something that gets implemented at the will of the university administrators.  For the most part, the administration doesn&#39;t want to mess with new policy because it&#39;s really expensive to implement any new policy, much less one that would most certainly be met with tough opposition from students.  Since a large portion of any college&#39;s income is from alumni donations, it is costly to make students hate you.  Millersville has been pushing to ban smoking on campus for some time; the push is primarily organized by the student senate and is supported by dozens of student and faculty signed petitions every year.		</div>

We don&#39;t know what type of long term effect breathing that in could have, just like we don&#39;t really know what kind of long term effect breathing in second-hand smoke outside has.  We know second-hand smoke in an enclosed environment can have nearly if not as much of an effect as smoking itself, but we don&#39;t know enough about it in an outdoor environment.  All we know is that it smells like it dissipates fairly quickly (Although it does linger for awhile.  I can easily smell the smoke of someone who is walking twenty feet in front of me).  Obviously this type of information would have to be researched more thoroughly before a federal ban, but that is kind of why no one is pushing for a federal ban right now.  In the meantime, more localized communities and organizations where individual people can have a far greater impact than on the national scene are making decisions that they think are in everyone&#39;s best interest.  The need for debate is necessary, but I hardly think it is a clear cut &quot;what the fuck my civil rights&quot; case.		</div>

						The argument that group A is having their rights infringed by the ban is as legitimate as the argument that group B WAS having their rights infringed without the ban.  Since this limits my personal freedom I say it&#39;s better to stray on the side of no ban.  But hey.  What do I know?<br /><br />edit:<br />you&#39;re overcomplicating the role that the constitution plays in this case.  And overstating it&#39;s role in the actual decision to instate the ban.		</div>

						I see a no-smoking ban on a campus as the same thing as a &quot;quiet&quot; campus or dorm or whatever.  Something you&#39;re doing that you enjoy (smoking) is making other people uncomfortable (and hell could be giving them lung cancer).  I know a couple people who live in &quot;quiet&quot; apartment complexes where on the lease it actually states they can&#39;t play rockband (go figure).  Graaahhh infringing on my rights&#33;  They own the land I presume, you&#39;re on their land, they could tell you you can&#39;t wear underwear there if they wanted to.		</div>

						If you&#39;re going to argue that the schools have a constitutional right to ban any activity they like, you&#39;ll win.  But that wasn&#39;t the initial argument Court tried to make.

No need to increase fuel efficiency in cars by law.  No need to make stricter laws for emissions inspection of large class transport vehicles.  No need to have stricter farming laws to prevent emission of nitrates into our water supplies which end up in our rain and then our air.  No need to sign the Kyoto Treaty.  No need to address through legislature many more pressing contributors to our dirty air.  Those bastard college kids and their cancer sticks are killing our environment and it needs to stop.  In bars.  Which you can choose to not go to.  Giving colleges a platform to launch a massive (and foolhardy) initiative to ban smoking on campus.		</div>

One of our inalienable rights is life.  Another is the <i>pursuit</i> of happiness.  The difference in phrasing between the two was deliberate and important:  If you do something that stops me from living, then you have infringed upon my right to life.  If I do something that stops you from <i>pursuing</i> your happiness, then I have infringed upon one of your inalienable rights.  But if I do something that makes you unhappy, that by no means infringes upon your <i>pursuit</i> of happiness.  The very idea of universal happiness is ludicrous, so the founding fathers made sure to specify that we simply have the right to pursue it.  If, within the context of our laws, you cannot find happiness through your pursuit, well then that sucks for you.<br /><br />With an outdoor ban in place, you can still pursue happiness.

						That may be a solution for the general public (smoking only in your home...), but this is a college campus.  They aren&#39;t supposed to be smoking anywhere on campus.  Aren&#39;t cigarettes addicting?  If it were easy to quit, I don&#39;t think many of them would be smoking anyway.<br /><br />Seriously, they should at least provide those smoke boxes that are at the shore or outside the Park City Mall.  Otherwise, some of the students may be distracted (or detracting) in class, because they didn&#39;t have time to walk off campus to get a few drags in between classes.		</div>

They aren&#39;t supposed to be smoking anywhere on campus.  Aren&#39;t cigarettes addicting?  If it were easy to quit, I don&#39;t think many of them would be smoking anyway.<br /><br />Seriously, they should at least provide those smoke boxes that are at the shore or outside the Park City Mall.  Otherwise, some of the students may be distracted (or detracting) in class, because they didn&#39;t have time to walk off campus to get a few drags in between classes.</div><br /><br />Who said anything about quitting?  No one&#39;s forcing them to go to school there, and no one is forcing them to quit smoking even if they do.  Heck, no one&#39;s forcing them to go to college at all.  If smoking was really that important to them, they could drop out.<br /><br />Perhaps setting up smoke boxes would be good decision for the school, but that&#39;s not really for any of us to decide (well, at least not us who do not attend Kutztown).		</div>

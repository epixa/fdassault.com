						I&#39;m kind of sick of reading about stupid fucking people making stupid fucking decisions and then having media outlets trying to make me feel sorry for those people.  This latest article about bankruptcy in America is a perfect example:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/11/16/business/16consumer.php" target="_blank">http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/11/16/bus.../16consumer.php</a><br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Tony and Carrie Forsyth, both 30, chose not to walk away from their house in Florida. The couple said they thought their financial situation would improve in 2006, when Forsyth accepted a promotion from his employer, a Michigan food distributor, that required them to move to Florida. But they could not sell their home in Ypsilanti, Michigan, so they decided to rent it out.<br /><br />In June 2006, the couple headed south and bought a house for &#36;220,000 in Tamarac, Florida, with no money down. Five months later, their tenants in Michigan stopped paying, and the family had to carry two mortgage payments, just as the adjustable-rate mortgage on their Michigan home reset to a higher interest rate. They lost the Michigan home to foreclosure in February 2007.<br /><br />By that time, however, the couple, who have two young daughters, were using credit cards to pay for food, utilities and clothes. After accumulating about &#36;20,000 in debt, they said, they realized that bankruptcy was the only way they could remain in their Florida home, whose value, meanwhile, had plunged 25 percent. They filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection this year, which permitted them to keep the house, and they agreed to repay a portion of their debts over the next three years.</div><br /><br />So let me get this straight.  Tony and Carrie Forsyth were in a financial bind, so their brilliant solution was to NOT sell their old house while simultaneously taking a variable-rate mortgage of <b>&#36;220,000</b> with <b>zero</b> money down and moving all the way across the country.  Then when their totally irresponsible gamble didn&#39;t pay off, they again choose not to sell their homes and instead file for bankruptcy, and I&#39;m suppose to feel sorry for them?<br /><br />Fuck you Tony and Carrie.		</div>

						Protip, if you&#39;re not putting 20% down on your house you&#39;re going to pay out the butthole in lenders insurance shit so the bank will loan you money.  If you have to do it, you&#39;re probably buying a house that is TOO FUCKING EXPENSIVE YOU STUPID CUNT.<br /><br />I enjoy the stories about people &quot;not spending money&quot; for a certain amount of time.  They usually end up making their squash buddy pay for the balls until he won&#39;t anymore, then saying they&#39;ll pay them back some other time.  They are just lessons in how to make all your friends completely hate you while not learning anything in the process&#33;		</div>

In this particular case, the companies were coasting on an artificially inflated market-place, and they assumed the fed would be able to lend them huge chunks of capital at hilariously low interest.  This has worked for a long time, but it doesn&#39;t work as well when every single one of them needs the loan.		</div>

						When my pops moved out of our old house he got to sell it himself and we had to find another place without that money.  It took time, but we found one that we could afford to pay off a 20% down payment on after saving for about 6 months straight and taking a bunch of my grandmothers money (she now has a piece of paper in a plastic cover for a grave marker).  The house had to be refinanced twice and eventually the payments settled down a little bit and with a little luck, my mom stayed away from being laid off and has moved up in pay consistently.  She just married a guy of about the same means, and both of them were living in tiny houses.  They have chosen to sell both houses and get a new one, that they can afford 20% down on and have reasonable payments on after that.  We are pricing our house about 50,000 dollars cheaper than our neighbors that sold 6 months ago because of the market, and because we want to flip it fast.<br /><br />Does my mom get free money for doing a good job?		</div>

						I frankly don&#39;t care too much about people like this as they don&#39;t have any effect on me beyond reading about them.

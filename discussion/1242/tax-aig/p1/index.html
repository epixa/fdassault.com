						Considering it isn&#39;t a tax, I&#39;m not too upset over it.  The scariest thing they&#39;ve considered in recent memory was giving them that much money in the first place while telling us there were safeguards in place to prevent this sort of shit.  AIG&#39;s execs are using their contracts (admittedly negotiated before the bailout) as a way of justifying the use of public funds to pay bonuses to each other.  What should have been done is a complete renegotiation of all contracts in the business units required to use the funds.  That wasn&#39;t done.  This is mostly a stupid publicity stunt to let the house democrats ride a wave of public opinion on this issue into another term.<br /><br />Don&#39;t want the government to interfere with your shit?  Worried about that are you?  Then don&#39;t take 30 billion dollars of public money and draw attention to how bad you are with money by throwing it away.<br /><br />I&#39;m pretty sure this isn&#39;t a slippery slope thing.  Just a stupid thing.<br /><br />edit: By the way it would have been equally outrageous for our government to force them to renege on their contracts, IMO.<br /><br />editII: Still the right thing to do.  (While giving them another 300 million or whatever it was was really really stupid)		</div>

						I&#39;m upset that my tax dollars (and the countries tax dollars) are paying to float a company that should sink into oblivion.  I&#39;m upset that the company won&#39;t take the proper steps to get itself to survive on its own.  I&#39;m upset that congress thought that handing them money would be a good idea.  I&#39;m upset that congress is &quot;surprised&quot; that things like this would happen.<br /><br />Overall, shit stinks.  SURPRISE&#33;<br /><br />Taxing the AIG &quot;bonuses&quot; is a band-aid on the mistake that congress created.  Seriously, it isn&#39;t going to help.  The precedent that this could create is risky, but at this moment it looks like a one time deal.  Congress is trying to save face.  They hand money over to a company that mismanaged its own money and act like it was a brilliant idea.  AIG mismanages the money, and then congress acts as if AIG is fully to blame.  Maybe they did pull the trigger, but the government handed them a loaded gun.  Congress should own up to their mistake in this, but instead they are just trying to look good.<br /><br />/when does the revolt begin?		</div>

						Gonna have to agree with most everyone else here gov. AIG isnt being taxed, they are being forced to sign an &quot;agree to pay&quot; on the money that was LOANED to them, its no different than if you took out a student loan for 15 credits of classes, dropped all the classes, bought a car, then paraded it around outside all the banks that gave you that money. <br /><br />I&#39;ll agree its kind of ridiculous that our government fucked up in the first place, gave AIG a ton of free money with little to no stipulations, and is now scrambling to get it back to save face.		</div>

						<a rel="nofollow" href="/profile/frat">@frat</a>: That analogy isn&#39;t really accurate.  If you receive a loan from the bank for school, you are not obligated to use that money for school at all.  However, banks that are in the business of giving school loans do so in such a way that money is paid to the school <i>first</i> and any leftover is paid directly to the student.  In that case, the student can still spend that extra money anyway they please.  The only time a bank could ask you for the money back would be if you signed a contract that said the money <i>must</i> be used to pay for tuition.  In this case, the lender (congress, sigh) handed the money directly over to AIG with little string attached.  Specifically, AIG was <i>not</i> obligated to renegotiate contracts to eliminate bonuses.  The degree to which AIG&#39;s actions are ethical is irrelevant -- congress does not and should not exist to mediate ethical claims.<br /><br />@andrew: This is what I find so scary about what they are considering.  Aside from sending nasty letters, in what twisted interpretation of the constitution does congress have the authority to demand payment from <i>anyone</i>?		</div>

						I am thinking that congress will end up NOT taxing them for the money. The word BONUS is being thrown about willy-nilly. Most Americans (myself included) heard &quot;paid out 165 million in bonuses&quot; and hemmoraged. Most Americans (myself included) associate the word BONUS with a sum of money paid to someone who has by doing his/her job EARNED THE COMPANY MONEY&#33;<br /><br />It is my understanding that these monies were not bonuses in that respect. It was a &quot;Retention Bonus&quot;. It was offered to these people so that they would stay and do their job until a certain date. These people most likely receive performance based bonuses. AIG was aware that they were going to have a bad year (did not realize at the time just how bad). The employees also realized this and realized that they would not make anywhere near as much money as they normally would because the performance based bonus was going to be very small or non-existent. Therefore in order to keep these people who (allegedly) knew how to do the job required working for the company they were offered a guaranteed set amount of money to remain with the company and hopefully things would be better by the end of the &quot;bonus&quot; period and things could go back to &quot;normal&quot;.<br /><br />These contracts and &quot;bonus&quot; amounts were agreed to BEFORE the full extent of the problem was realized. Contractually I feel AIG should pay the bonuses. I hate to see that much money (which isn&#39;t much compared to the amounts loaned) paid to the people partially responsible for the situation.<br /><br />It is possible that congress is trying to stir up a big stink about all of this to try and obscure their role in the whole mess. And my friends CONGRESS PLAYED A BIG ROLE&#33; At least that is what my understanding is. A bit of legislation in 2001 regarding certain types of loans and how they were to be handled (i think it was securitiezed loans). (google it and get even angrier because once again congress has taken a trip on the failboat).<br /><br />Stopping here because have had too little time to look into the whole mess further and fear the information I have gathered could be erroneous.<br /><br /><br />regarding the above spiel punctuate to taste and enjoy.		</div>

As much as i hate to see the money go, Congress should not make a &quot;one shot with a silver bullet tax&quot; (I thunked that up mahself). I am not an expert on what Congress can and cannot legally do regarding taxation. However it would not be the first time they have played fast and loose with the law.

All under the authority of our lovely constitution.<br /><br />awesome.<br /><br />Notice that our gov&#39;t *doesn&#39;t* do this.		</div>

						Eminent Domain doesn&#39;t apply at all.  Under eminent domain, if the government decides it is in the public&#39;s best interest to have your property, they must pay you market value.  The power of eminent domain is not that the government can seize your property on the cheap but rather that if it does decide to pay you market value, you must oblige.  Even then, there are strict limitations on what the property seized can be used for (specifically, the government must explicitly define exactly who will use it and what they will use it for during eminent domain proceedings).  Furthermore, the federal government&#39;s ability to exercise eminent domain is far less potent than the state&#39;s ability -- both by design and recent executive orders signed by Bush.<br /><br />All of that is pretty much irrelevant though since money is <i>not</i> currently considered &quot;property&quot; by the federal government, so eminent domain couldn&#39;t possibly apply anyway.		</div>

The circumstances are pretty specific.  Do I like it?  No.  I just see a whole lot of outrage about an event that may or may not occur based entirely on public opinion.<br /><br />Mob rule sucks.</div><br /><br />1. The market determines fair market value.  I&#39;m not a property appraiser,  so I don&#39;t know the formulas involved, but determining the market value is done every single day whenever a house (or anything, really) is appraised.  There is a reason why you won&#39;t get dramatically different appraisals from different people.  Unless of course your appraiser is also your buyer, in which case you should always be cautious (which I&#39;ll elaborate on in point 3).<br /><br />2. Eminent domain does not say that the property must be used by the public -- only that it must benefit the public.  In fact, aside from building roads, eminent domain is almost always exercised in such a way that gives ownership of the land to a private organization.  My objections would be heard (which I&#39;ll elaborate on in point 3).<br /><br />3.  All citizens have the right to challenge a claim of eminent domain during litigation prior to the sale of their property.  If you have objections about the eminent domain request, this is where they could first be heard (legally speaking).  If this course of action fails and your property is still ultimately seized, you can challenge the eminent domain ruling through the judicial system all the way up to the supreme court.  This has happened, and the plaintiffs have won.  There is no precedent set otherwise.<br /><br />Mob rule does suck; that&#39;s why the notion that this country should be a &quot;democracy&quot; is dangerous and disturbing.<br /><br />But regardless, that is not what congress wants to do, as you and I have both already said.  As I type this, I actually just heard on NPR (I haven&#39;t substantiated it) that congress is planning to push a bill through to levy a <b>90% tax retroactively</b> to all bonuses given to people making over 250k a year at companies that received bailout money.  The implications of that are absolutely <i>horrifying</i>.		</div>

The market determines fair market value.  I&#39;m not a property appraiser,  so I don&#39;t know the formulas involved, but determining the market value is done every single day whenever a house (or anything, really) is appraised.  There is a reason why you won&#39;t get dramatically different appraisals from different people.  Unless of course your appraiser is also your buyer, in which case you should always be cautious (which I&#39;ll elaborate on in point 3).<br /><br /><b>I believe this is dont via 2 appraisers</b><br /><br />2. Eminent domain does not say that the property must be used by the public -- only that it must benefit the public.  In fact, aside from building roads, eminent domain is almost always exercised in such a way that gives ownership of the land to a private organization.  My objections would be heard (which I&#39;ll elaborate on in point 3).<br /><br /><br /><b>This is correct. Eminent domain has been used for private things such as malls and other retail outlets.</b><br />3.  All citizens have the right to challenge a claim of eminent domain during litigation prior to the sale of their property.  If you have objections about the eminent domain request, this is where they could first be heard (legally speaking).  If this course of action fails and your property is still ultimately seized, you can challenge the eminent domain ruling through the judicial system all the way up to the supreme court.  This has happened, and the plaintiffs have won.  There is no precedent set otherwise.<br /><br />Mob rule does suck; that&#39;s why the notion that this country should be a &quot;democracy&quot; is dangerous and disturbing.<br /><br />But regardless, that is not what congress wants to do, as you and I have both already said.  As I type this, I actually just heard on NPR (I haven&#39;t substantiated it) that congress is planning to push a bill through to levy a <b>90% tax retroactively</b> to all bonuses given to people making over 250k a year at companies that received bailout money.  The implications of that are absolutely <i>horrifying</i>.</div><br /><br /><br />Anyway, I agree with Gov here that the whole situation is pretty messed up.  The government has no business telling a company who can give a bonus to who, and how much they are allowed to give.  They are also talking about regulating executive pay which is just as bad.  America is built on having a pretty free market, which as made us attractive to do business in.  We are heading down a road that will make us more and more like Europe in their more socialist tendencies.  <br /><br />And the news companies are not helping at all.  I don&#39;t watch a ton of 24 hours news but I do catch it once and a while and I heard a lot about outrage over the bonuses.  Its a fricken 1xxmilliong out of BILLIONS.  They were contracts made prior to the bailout and are still should be considered a bond.  Besides, who knows what the circumstances of these bonuses are?  The news raises hell on shit that doesn&#39;t matter while the important stuff is only noted on here and there.<br /><br />We are so screwed.  Obama&#39;s budget and all.<br /><br /><br /><br />		</div>

						This might be jumping on Obama&#39;s dick, but maybe it was never his intention to tax these fuckers.

						Well, whether that was his plan or not, I am very glad that it is turning out this way.  Regardless of the result though, I am concerned that the threat of passing unconstitutional, reactionary legislation is being used as a means to pressure people into doing something.  This is a bill that in the best case should not have ever been imagined and in worst case should have been laughed off the floor.		</div>

						It was intended to be a criticism of the legislative branch (specifically the house).<br /><br />I was very refreshed to hear Obama say that it was unconstitutional (although I would like to point out that he said something along the lines of &quot;probably&quot; unconstitutional).  However, I wish he had gone one step further and said he would veto it on those grounds, but he and his administration have been extremely reluctant to do so.		</div>

The FP division was definitely almost exclusively responsible for the near collapse of the company, but even within the division the blame can only be placed with a small number of people.  The entire division wasn&#39;t responsible for this mess.  As the recent publicly released resignation letter to Libby from one of the higher-ups in that division describes, most of the people that were the cause of this mess are no longer with the company.  There are plenty of people in the FP division that have responsibly maintained profitability and are essential to the turn-around in the company.  And aside from these bonuses, they haven&#39;t been paid for the past year.<br /><br />People are outraged only because they want something to be outraged about.  The people responsible for the reckless decision-making in AIG are largely gone, and the people that are left who have decided to take the huge burden of turning the company around are doing so at their own expense -- they aren&#39;t getting paid and their reputations and dignity are getting dragged through the mud.  And worse still, they are on the verge of having a gross invasion of their privacy by their own company and their own government, and their very lives are being threatened by hundreds of emails and letters through AIG daily.<br /><br />This whole mess is a travesty, and I am most certainly not on the side of my fellow paupers.  I don&#39;t think lynch mobs are anymore justified just because the victim is white and wealthy.		</div>

						Americans can be upset.  The letter does spell out a lot, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that it is tax payers money.  If AIG never got bailed out to begin with, none of those people would have those jobs to begin with.  It boils down to the many people losing their jobs, because their company had to cut back, and then AIG employees get to keep their job, because they get tax money.  He has every right to complain, but so does everyone else.<br /><br />Bottom line: He had a job, because the government took the money from citizens to support it.  The citizens were robbed, and they are angry at the people who asked for it to happen.		</div>

						nice guy, but i wouldn&#39;t have voted for him anyways. it will be interesting to see who his supporters side with. <br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Edwards Drops Out of Race for President<br />By JULIE BOSMAN and JEFF ZELENY<br /><br />NEW ORLEANS — John Edwards, the progressive Democratic candidate who made a populist, antipoverty message the centerpiece of his campaign, announced his exit from the presidential primary race on Wednesday, saying he was stepping aside “so that history can blaze its path.” Mr. Edwards announced his decision at the same place where he began his candidacy in January 2006 — New Orleans — using a row of homes still badly damaged from Hurricane Katrina as his backdrop. He did not endorse his two chief rivals, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, but he said he had spoken to them by phone and asked them both to continue drawing attention to the primary themes of his campaign.<br /><br />“They have both pledged to me — and more importantly through me to America — that they will make ending poverty central to their campaign for the presidency,” he said.<br /><br />Throughout this season, Mr. Edwards had not been able to break through the dueling high-profile candidacies of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama. And he had not been able to raise the kind of money that his two chief rivals had early on.<br /><br />Mr. Edwards placed a distant third Tuesday night in Florida’s primary. And even more disappointing, as a native of South Carolina, he finished in the mid-teens there, as Mr. Obama won overwhelmingly. Mr. Edwards had campaigned heavily in Iowa for months and months, fine-tuning a populist message and issuing many proposals, including one on health care, long before his rivals issued theirs. In the caucuses, he finished second, but just about a percentage point ahead of Mrs. Clinton.<br /><br />Despite never having captured a first-place finish, Mr. Edwards had insisted that his campaign would carry on “to the convention.” And as the primary season headed toward Super Tuesday, and several of the big Southern states, Mr. Edwards was expected to draw a swath of white voters his way.<br /><br />Indeed, Mr. Edwards was poised to collect enough delegates in early nominating contests to potentially influence the outcome at the Democratic nominating convention in August, if neither Mrs. Clinton nor Mr. Obama won enough delegates to clinch the nomination.<br /><br />But Mr. Edwards began notifying close advisers and longtime supporters about his decision to drop out of the race early today. It was a decision rooted simply in the political reality of the challenges he faced in the 22 states holding contests on Feb. 5, according to people familiar with the decision, and had nothing to do with the health of his wife, Elizabeth Edwards, who has been battling cancer.<br /><br />Mrs. Edwards and the couple’s two young children traveled with him and were on hand in New Orleans for his speech this afternoon.<br /><br />For days, the question of whether he would stay in the race was an off-limits topic of conversation among those in his inner circle, but several major contributors began growing antsy, with some eager to begin lining up with either Mr. Obama or Mrs. Clinton.<br /><br />In the days leading up to the South Carolina primary, chatter among contributors intensified, but Mr. Edwards and his advisers worked to tamp down the speculation. His third-place finish, though, essentially sealed the decision and several contributors began raising concern that he was acting as a spoiler in the race.<br /><br />John C. Moylan, a close friend and campaign adviser, said this morning that Mr. Edwards came to the decision to drop out within the last 24 hours.<br /><br />“I think the timing now felt right to him,” Mr. Moylan said. “He felt like it would do more good if he stepped aside.<br /><br />“I don’t think there was one overriding decision that says you have to get out now,” he added. “Clearly he could have stuck it out.”<br /><br />Mr. Edwards decision to leave the race has set off a furious — and delicate — scramble from Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama. Mr. Edwards spoke to each of his two rivals in separate conversations on Tuesday for several minutes. According to people familiar with the conversations, Mr. Edwards offered no specific timeline for when he would withdraw or whether he would endorse one of their candidacies.<br /><br />In the hours leading up to his speech in New Orleans, Mr. Edwards was placing calls to several important supporters in Iowa and other states, as well as to his longtime financial contributors.<br /><br />“We could have stayed in and been competitive in some of the Feb. 5 states, but the path to winning the nomination had expired,” said one longtime associate of Mr. Edwards who spoke to him on Wednesday, but agreed to be interviewed on the condition of anonymity until Mr. Edwards made his formal announcement. “In the last couple of days, he made the decision that it was time to get out.”<br /><br />Since the New Hampshire primary, Mrs. Clinton has reached out to Mr. Edwards aggressively, through telephone calls and private meetings. Mr. Obama has spent far less time courting Mr. Edwards, according to people familiar with the talks.<br /><br />Mr. Obama, who was campaigning in Colorado on Wednesday, heard the news about Mr. Edwards’ withdrawal from the race while he was doing his morning workout. Aides said he would give his public comments on Mr. Edwards’s decision today during a speech in Denver.<br /><br />The decision by Mr. Edwards marks the end of his second attempt at the presidency. His 2004 bid ended with an unsuccessful run as John Kerry’s vice presidential running mate.<br /><br />The son of a textile worker from Robbins, N.C., Mr. Edwards built a highly successful law practice before entering politics, frequently securing million-dollar verdicts in medical malpractice claims and damage lawsuits against corporations on behalf of injured people. In fact, Mr. Edwards showed little inclination to seek public office until the death of his 16-year-old son, Wade, in a 1996 traffic accident.<br /><br />Over the next year, Mr. Edwards launched a foundation and a scholarship fund in memory of his son. In 1998, in his first campaign, he defeated Senator Lauch Faircloth, a conservative Democrat-turned-Republican, for a Senate seat.</div><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/us/politics/30cnd-edwards.html?hp" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/us/polit...edwards.html?hp</a>		</div>

He&#39;s a greedy, immoral lawyer that made his money through frivolous lawsuits like those that plaque this country every day.  His career epitomizes the downfall of America.</div><br /><br />Edwards practiced law in North Carolina for nearly two decades. He spent the first two years of his legal career as a junior associate in a law firm that represented corporate defendants, then moved on to the plaintiff&#39;s work for which he became famous. He represented children who developed cerebral palsy in lawsuits against their mothers&#39; doctors and hospitals; a woman who underwent a double mastectomy based on a false diagnosis of cancer; he represented a child whose parents were killed when their car was smashed by a big rig; he represented Valerie Lakey.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><i><span>July 13, 2004 | On a summer evening in 1993, David Lakey took his little girl swimming at a recreation center in Raleigh, N.C. Valerie Lakey was 5 years old, a good swimmer, and she and her friends liked to splash around in the children&#39;s wading pool that stayed open a little later than the big pool where they usually swam.<br /><br />That&#39;s what Valerie was doing when a nearby mom heard her call out for help. Valerie was sitting on the bottom of the shallow pool, and the suction from the drain was holding her down. David Lakey raced to free his daughter but couldn&#39;t. Other parents jumped in the water to help, but they couldn&#39;t get Valerie loose. Valerie was scared, and she began to say that her stomach hurt.<br /><br />Time passed, and somebody figured out how to turn off the pool&#39;s pump. The suction broke, and Valerie was released from its grip. But as David Lakey pulled his daughter from the water, blood and tissue filled the pool. Valerie&#39;s intestines had been sucked out.<br /><br />David Lakey slumped to the ground on the side of the pool. He held his daughter on his chest, praying as they waited for an ambulance. Over and over, he told Valerie, &quot;Daddy loves you. Daddy loves you. Daddy loves you.&quot;<br /><br />This account of what happened to Valerie Lakey comes from &quot;Four Trials,&quot; the book John Edwards wrote last year as he prepared to run for the presidency. Edwards represented Valerie in a lawsuit against the company that made the drain cover in that swimming pool. A jury awarded her &#36;25 million, compensation for a life of intravenous feedings and colostomy bags.<br /><br />Tucker Carlson has heard about Valerie&#39;s case. It&#39;s the one, apparently, that causes him to dismiss John Edwards as a &quot;personal-injury lawyer specializing in Jacuzzi cases.&quot; </span></i><br /></div></blockquote><br />&quot;The Republicans want to put Edwards out there as a &#39;trial lawyer,&#39; but I don&#39;t think it cuts deeply as an issue because he&#39;s not your stereotypical, caricaturable ambulance chaser,&quot; says Ferrel Guillory, director of the University of North Carolina&#39;s Program on Southern Politics, Media and Public Life. &quot;The kind of clients that Edwards represented are everyday folks, folks like you and me, people who feel aggrieved by powerful forces out there, whether it&#39;s an HMO or a hospital or something else.&quot;<br /><br />Mike Dayton, who watched Edwards&#39; career while working as the editor of the North Carolina Lawyers Weekly, said that Edwards&#39; clients &quot;were almost to a person these catastrophically injured or killed plaintiffs. They&#39;re certainly sympathetic in their own right, and it&#39;s hard not to feel the pain of those people and want to do right by them.&quot;		</div>

I met her loving, determined parents, who were hoping for a way to help pay for her costly care, and to make sure other families wouldn&#39;t suffer as they had. Back then, in 1985,1 was a young North Carolina trial lawyer starting to build a name as someone willing to take cases others rejected as long shots. This was exactly that. The insurance companies were skilled at making cases like this &#39;go away.&#39; The Campbells had no money, and the trial would be long, complicated and expensive. If we lost, neither the Campbells nor I would receive a dime. But there was no question that these were risks worth taking for Jennifer.&quot;<br /><br />This is a powerful image: A selfless lawyer who without any guarantee of personal gain dedicated his time to pursing justice on behalf a little girl who had been wronged in the very hour of her birth.<br /><br />Referring to this case, The New York Times described how &quot;Edwards stood before a jury and channeled the words of an unborn baby girl.&quot;<br /><br />Citing the record of a fetal heartbeat monitor as evidence, Edwards told the jury: &quot;She said at 3, Tm fine.&#39; She said at 4, Tm having a little trouble, but I&#39;m doing OK&#39; Five, she said, Tm having problems.&#39; At 5:30, she said, &#39;I need out.&#39;&quot;<br /><br />&quot;She speaks to you through me,&quot; Edwards said to the jurors. &quot;And I have to tell you right now-I didn&#39;t plan to talk about this-rieht now I feel her. I feel her presence. She&#39;s inside me, and she&#39;s talking to you.&quot;<br /><br />According to The New York Times, &quot;The jury came back with a &#36;6.5-million verdict in the cerebral palsy case, and Mr. Edwards established his reputation as the state&#39;s most feared plaintiff&#39;s lawyer.&quot;</div>		</div>

						I don&#39;t mind suing for malpractice.  Suing for amounts and number of instances that make it impractical for people to afford health insurance because of rising costs I do care about.  You really want to be a defender of the people?  Sue for malpractice pro bono, and get the medical procedures changed.  Don&#39;t bankrupt a medical clinic.<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">The American Medical Association lists North Carolina’s current health care situation as a “crisis” and blames it on medical-malpractice lawsuits such as the ones that made Democratic vice-presidential candidate Sen. John Edwards a millionaire many times over.<br />One of the most successful personal-injury lawyers in North Carolina history, Mr. Edwards won dozens of lawsuits against doctors and hospitals across the state that he now represents in the Senate. He won more than 50 cases with verdicts or settlements of &#36;1 million or more, according to North Carolina Lawyers Weekly, and 31 of those were medical-malpractice suits.<br /><br />During his 20 years of suing doctors and hospitals, he pioneered the art of blaming psychiatrists for patients who commit suicide and blaming doctors for delivering babies with cerebral palsy, according to doctors, fellow lawyers and legal observers who followed Mr. Edwards’ career in North Carolina.<br />“The John Edwards we know crushed [obstetrics, gynecology] and neurosurgery in North Carolina,” said Dr. Craig VanDerVeer, a Charlotte neurosurgeon. “As a result, thousands of patients lost their health care.”<br />“And all of this for the little people?” he asked, a reference to Mr. Edwards’ argument that he represented regular people against mighty foes such as prosperous doctors and big insurance companies. “How many little people do you know who will supply you with &#36;60 million in legal fees over a couple of years?”<br />Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Edwards declined to comment beyond e-mailing his and John Kerry’s “real plan for medical-malpractice reform.”<br />The plan calls for one measure that Mr. Edwards previously had said is meaningless and does not impose caps on verdicts for economic damages or limits on attorneys’ fees.<br />One of his most noted victories was a &#36;23 million settlement he got from a 1995 case — his last before joining the Senate — in which he sued the doctor, gynecological clinic, anesthesiologist and hospital involved in the birth of Bailey Griffin, who had cerebral palsy and other medical problems.<br />Linking complications during childbirth to cerebral palsy became a specialty for Mr. Edwards. In the courtroom, he was known to dramatize the events at birth by speaking to jurors as if he were the unborn baby, begging for help, begging to be let out of the womb.<br />“He was very good at it,” said Dr. John Schmitt, an obstetrician and gynecologist who used to practice in Mr. Edwards’ hometown of Raleigh. “But the science behind a lot of his arguments was flawed.”<br />In 2003, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists published a joint study that cast serious doubt on whether events at childbirth cause cerebral palsy. The “vast majority” of cerebral palsy cases originate long before childbirth, according to the study.<br />“Now, he would have a much harder time proving a lot of his cases,” said Dr. Schmitt, who now practices at the University of Virginia Health System.<br />Another profitable area of litigation for Mr. Edwards was lawsuits against psychiatrists whose patients committed suicide.<br />In 1991, he won &#36;2.2 million for the estate of a woman who hanged herself in a hospital after being removed from suicide watch. It was the first successful medical-malpractice case in Mr. Edwards’ home of Wake County.<br />During jury selection, Mr. Edwards asked potential jurors whether they could hold a doctor responsible for the suicide of their patients.<br />“I got a lot of speeches from potential jurors who said they did not understand how that doctor could be responsible,” Mr. Edwards recalled in an interview shortly after the trial. Those persons were excluded from the jury.<br />In the end, Mr. Edwards scored &#36;1.5 million for “wrongful death” and &#36;175,000 in “emotional distress” for the woman’s children.<br />“One thing I was grappling with was how to explain to the jury the difference between loss of companionship and society — the things under the wrongful-death statute — and emotional pain and suffering, which superficially sound like the same thing,” he said at the time. “What we did was to tell them the wrongful-death damages are for the loss of all the things that a mother does for the child. But the emotional pain and suffering damages represent the grieving. The pain is something you feel over the death of your mother.”<br />In 1995, as Mr. Edwards neared the pinnacle of his success, Lawyers Weekly reported on the state’s 50 biggest settlements of the year.<br />“Like last year, the medical malpractice category leads the new list, accounting for 16 cases — or 32 percent — three points better than last year,” the magazine reported. “By and large, that upward trend had held since 1992, when only four [medical malpractice] cases made the survey.”<br />Mr. Edwards was singled out.<br />“Another reason for this year’s [medical malpractice] jump was a strong showing by the Raleigh firm of Edwards &amp; Kirby,” it reported. “Partner John Edwards was lead counsel in eight of the 16 medical malpractice cases in the top 50.”<br />Later in that article, Mr. Edwards was interviewed about the &#36;5 million he won from doctors who delivered Ethan L. Bedrick, who had cerebral palsy. Mr. Edwards credited the jury focus groups that he routinely used to help prepare his arguments.<br />“They gave me several bits and pieces of information to use when addressing the jury,” Mr. Edwards was quoted saying. “You can use them to decide whether to get involved in a case or whether to accept a settlement offer, but our primary use is trial presentation.”<br />The article went on to observe: “Focus groups can be put together for as little as &#36;300, according to Edwards — a small investment compared to the &#36;5 million won in Bedrick.”<br />It is not clear just how much Mr. Edwards made as a lawyer, but estimates based on a review of his lawsuit settlements and Senate records place his fortune at about &#36;38 million.<br />Like many Democrats, Mr. Edwards has benefited from the generosity of fellow trial lawyers, who have given millions of dollars to Mr. Edwards’ political campaigns and other political endeavors.<br />Part of the platform that Mr. Edwards is running on includes medical-malpractice reform. The Democrats’ plan would go after insurance companies that increase doctors’ premiums and ban lawyers and plaintiffs for 10 years if they file three frivolous lawsuits.<br />One tenet of their plan would “require that individuals making medical-malpractice claims first go before a qualified medical specialist to make sure a reasonable grievance exists.”<br />However, Mr. Edwards said in a 1995 interview that such pre-screening is unnecessary.<br />“Pre-screening as a concept is very good, but it’s already done by every experienced malpractice lawyer,” he told North Carolina Lawyers Weekly.<br />As a result of these and other cases, insurance rates for doctors have skyrocketed — putting some out of business and driving others away, especially from rural areas. And doctors who have lost cases to Mr. Edwards have been bankrupted.<br />Patients, meanwhile, are left with rising health care costs and fewer — if any — doctors in their area. It is increasingly a nationwide problem, physicians say.<br />Dr. VanDerVeer, the Charlotte neurosurgeon, recalled one recent night on duty when two patients arrived in an emergency room in Myrtle Beach, S.C., where the area’s last neurosurgeons quit earlier this year.<br />“No one in Myrtle Beach would accept responsibility for these patients,” he said. And because it was raining, the helicopters were grounded, so the patients were loaded into ambulances and driven the four hours to Charlotte.<br />Upon arrival, one patient had died, and the other learned that she merely had a minor concussion — and a &#36;6,000 bill for the ambulance ride.<br />“That’s just one little slice of life here,” Dr. VanDerVeer said. “It’s a direct result of the medical-malpractice situation that John Edwards fomented.”<br />Dr. Schmitt had spent 20 years delivering babies in Raleigh. Though he had no claims against him, his insurance tripled in one year. With no assurances that his rates would ever drop, or just stop rising, he left town.<br />For Mr. Edwards’ part, he doesn’t necessarily begrudge the doctors he sues.<br />In the book he wrote while campaigning for president, “Four Trials,” Mr. Edwards referred to the doctors who he’d won millions from in two cases.<br />“In the E.G. Sawyer case and the Jennifer Campbell case, the defendants were not malevolent but were caring and competent doctors who worked in good hospitals and yet made grievous mistakes,” he wrote. “They had erred in their judgment, but no one could despise them.”<br />Doctors, however, take it all a bit more personally.<br />“We are currently being sued out of existence,” Dr. VanDerVeer said. “People have to choose whether they want these lawyers to make gazillions of dollars in pain and suffering awards or whether they want health care.”</div><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.therazor.org/?p=841" target="_blank">http://www.therazor.org/?p=841</a>		</div>

						First things first, I&#39;m for this &quot;bailout&quot; even though the term coined by the media is just not true. No firm will be made whole, and the losses they&#39;re going to face will be disastrous. Government intervention is an anathema -- not for the firms, but for the global economy. <br /><br />We need these huge financial corporations to deleverage. Everyone agrees with that. However, no one wants to lever up; and let&#39;s be honest, would you? Would you purchase toxic assets that pay little to no interest, that have little to no intrinsic value, and maintain the burden of holding them to maturity (up to 29 years)? No, you wouldn&#39;t. You don&#39;t have the cash on hand to do so. The government however, does. <br /><br />As horrendous as this may sound, pragmatism should trump philosophy and we need to look at the current economic situation. TED spreads are outrageously high (past 300), LIBOR is above 6%, gold is moving towards &#36;900, and the Dow fluctuating 2000 points per week (net fluctuations); the global economy appears to be walking on the ledge of an abyss. Congress will not let this happen - they are not ignorant and they understand that philosophical grandstanding will come at a later date. There will be a time where we pay attention to the exorbitant bonuses of executives, but that time is not now. WaMu&#39;s demise couldn&#39;t have happened at a worse time, even if it was bound to happen. It will play the role as fog over a war-torn battlefield and distract us from making the correct decisions.<br /><br />It&#39;s also important that the &#36;700 billion bill that&#39;s been proposed is a MAXIMUM amount, and it is actually possible for the government to purchase these toxic assets at fractions of pennies on the dollar, turn the assets around, hold them to maturity, and make a few hundred billion. The potential for making money off of these situations is possible, not likely, but if managed wisely definitely a possibility. They could, theoretically, start reselling them when the economy turns around in a few years, making  10%. Who would buy them? I&#39;m not sure, but once the housing market turns around, people will want to get their feet wet a little bit by only spending pennies on the dollar.<br /><br />With regard to economic data, we are fighting off a recession. The leading indicator is unemployment, which has been on the rise. Last week jobless claims shot to 493k (up from 461k). This isn&#39;t taking into consideration the current impact of natural disasters (IKE) and how they will affect our unemployment levels. Virtually every single time unemployment has risen above 400,000 a recession either followed quickly or was already extant. This leads to weakness in retail sales as disposable income takes a huge hit. The depression upon the housing industry and the frailty of the big 3 auto makers is probably a good indication that we&#39;re going to pass 500,000 unemployed before the new years, and once wall street lays off another 25% and the south recovers from Ike, expect those numbers to increase above 550k. That&#39;s greater than 8%. But it is important to realize that we&#39;ve faced depressions, recessions, and a frightening lack of consumer confidence before -- and our current economic infrastructure has been manipulated over the past 50 years to be resilient, and will bounce back. Don&#39;t expect it anytime soon, and don&#39;t quit your job as the job market is about to approach the hardest times in the last quarter century.<br /><br />As you can tell, this &#39;bailout&#39; isn&#39;t for wall street. It&#39;s for everybody. It&#39;s for the credit markets that have been broken. No one is willing to part with cash which means that the long term economic value of certain credit structures are well below any reasonable estimate. If you claim &quot;let the banks fail&quot; please understand what you&#39;re saying. You&#39;re worried about taxpayers monies, but not about the average Joe who has a pension fund, IRA, or a savings account. Insurance only covers a certain amount of that. Imagine having a checking/savings account with WaMu and having it be above &#36;100,000. If JPMorgan Chase didn&#39;t purchase WaMu, you&#39;d lose anything you had above &#36;100,000. So all that money you saved over the past 30 years? Gone. You&#39;re &#36;500,000 retirement fund? Gone. Planning on buying a house? Sorry. Good luck taking a third mortgage at the current rates.<br /><br />I have no idea what is going to happen with this rescue. All I know is I&#39;ll be scared out of my mind if a deal isn&#39;t reached, and soon. It&#39;s possible that Paulson is going to plug the idea of creating an entity, inject &#36;100 billion in it, have the government manage, run, and maintain it, and have it contain all the toxic assets. In exchange for the toxic assets, the companies who currently own them (before transfer of ownership) will be required to use a large chunk of the &#36;100 billion to invest BACK into the governments entity, in the shape of stock. This would mean whatever happens to the newly formed entity wouldn&#39;t affect taxpayers, but the original companies the toxic assets came from (equity shareholders). This would accomplish two things: have minimal affect on taxpayers, and unload the burden of the assets these have on the banks.<br /><br />Like I said before, I have no idea what&#39;s going to happen by today&#39;s end, but I&#39;m highly engaged in following the story. I hope after reading this you understand a little bit more, will give the government a little bit more slack in correcting this situation, and realize the ripple effect that the global economy would incur. And please don&#39;t say &quot;the stock market has been fine for the past two weeks, I think that means the economy is fine without a bailout.&quot; That&#39;s just horribly ignorant: people are waiting for a response before taking massive positions. That, and options are at an all time high for most major indices and straddles are very expensive (people expect a major market shift within the next 3 months). Saying that the stock market has been doing decently is the same as saying that the GDP that&#39;s going to be announced today is a major indicator of the economy -- it isn&#39;t. The GDP figures are going to be 6 months old, and frankly when dealing with what we have on our hands right now, are completely irrelevant.		</div>

						There&#39;s a lot to respond to up there.<br /><br />I&#39;ll start by tackling the claim that this mess affects the average joe.  The average joe DOESN&#39;T have a 401k.  He doesn&#39;t have a pension, and he doesn&#39;t have over 100k in savings.  The average joe lives paycheck to paycheck busting his ass hoping he doesn&#39;t get laid off or fired before getting his pension locked in.  If you&#39;ve got over 100k in the bank you should move everything over 100k to other accounts at other banks.  And you shouldn&#39;t have gone over 100k to begin with in one account.  (Even though the FDIC doesn&#39;t have enough money to insure all our money anyway...)<br /><br />What this &#39;bailout&#39; (I&#39;ll accept that the name is terrible)  is doing is propping up our imaginary economy.  Gold is shifting towards its real value in relation to our money.  The DOW wouldn&#39;t be so fucking crazy right now if people weren&#39;t STILL allowed to short sell.  Dumping money into the problem is supposed to make these people calm down?  I&#39;d be shitting bricks about the soon to be through the roof inflation rates.<br /><br />I also find it funny that we wouldn&#39;t trust our government to run anything until we&#39;re worried about OUR money.  And I find the assertion that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/" target="_blank">our government has this money</a> laughable.<br /><br />To polish this off, I know you are very well versed in the market.  But:<br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain"><b>Saying that the stock market has been doing decently is the same as saying that the GDP that&#39;s going to be announced today is a major indicator of the economy</b> -- it isn&#39;t. The GDP figures are going to be 6 months old, and frankly when dealing with what we have on our hands right now, are completely irrelevant.</div><br /><br />No.  It&#39;s not anything like that at all.  Not even remotely and you know it.  That&#39;s a terrible comparison and I find it kind of insulting that you think a person such as myself, a vocal critic of this proposal, would buy it.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.insidefutures.com/charts/index.php?sym=DJU08&amp;a=D&amp;volume=1&amp;type=LINE&amp;studies=RSI;MACD" target="_blank">People ARE taking massive positions</a><br /><br />You talk alot about the repercussions of doing nothing.  You don&#39;t mention the repercussions of giving one man free reign over &#36;2,296.60 for every man woman and child in this country without oversight or instructions.<br /><br />I&#39;m not suggesting that we let the banks fail, I&#39;d agree that there probably would be ripple effects that would reach across the pond and fuck shit up all over the world.  I&#39;m just saying that using that *theoretical concept of a very complicated and never seen before situation* as a justification for the single sharpest turn towards socialism this country has ever taken might be the wrong approach.  Cooler heads prevail.  Let&#39;s think about this instead of throwing money that we don&#39;t have at the problem.<br /><br />For Christ&#39;s sake man&#33;  China isn&#39;t going to give us any more money.  Indefinitely.  We&#39;ve spent the last 8 years writing checks our economy couldn&#39;t cash, and propping up industries that made money off of money that didn&#39;t exist.  <br /><br />I&#39;ll take severe pain for the next 10 years over a slow grinding death by national debt over then next 50.  It&#39;s simply irresponsible to pass this bill as currently outlined.<br /><br />/take the long view dewd.		</div>

It was just really disingenuous the way you started with a comparison between watching the market, which updates constantly, and watching the GDP reports, which are updated semiannually - then saying, &quot;The GDP figures are going to be 6 months old, and frankly when dealing with what we have on our hands right now, are completely irrelevant.&quot;<br /><br />It implied that looking at the market was irrelevant to the situation because it&#39;s so out of date, which isn&#39;t the case.

Perhaps I am overreacting by saying I&#39;m insulted, but watching the market is not only relevant, but crucial in diagnosing and treating the problem.  CPI, unemployment and housing starts may be more accurate representations of the state of things, but they only tell you what the problem may be, not where the problem truly exists and originated, nor what you need to do to fix it.<br /><br />I think we&#39;re using different ideas of what might be relevant to the conversation, perhaps because we&#39;re trying to have different conversations about the same subject.		</div>

It was the federal government getting UNINVOLVED with the market that led to this.  Dissolution of the Federal Government isn&#39;t the solution to everything.  If anything, this is a situation they were MADE for.  A big maze of red tape?  Good, stand in front of the market and make it less appealing to people who shouldn&#39;t be there in the first place.<br /><br />It&#39;s like your system BIOS.  They could make it editable from the GUI, but they keep it only accessible with an F key during boot up and they keep it friggin&#39; hideous.

						I&#39;m not talking about what we did in the past eight years.  This has been a problem brewing since the great depression as the federal government gets more and more involved to &quot;help the people&quot; get homes.  When you create government-sponsored companies that can&#39;t realistically be competed against and require that banks give mortgages to people that should not get them in an absolutely absurd attempt to make all Americans own a house, you get a recipe for disaster.<br /><br />You can&#39;t blame the market for doing what it does best.  It makes money given its circumstances.  And since it is necessary and natural for the market to fail periodically, don&#39;t make it so that when it does fail, the whole fucking economy collapses and the federal government has to get even more involved.<br /><br />I&#39;m not saying that nothing should be done now, I&#39;m saying that nothing would have had to be done if FDR, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton hadn&#39;t fucked around with shit they shouldn&#39;t be fucking around with.		</div>

						While Bill Clinton definitely contributed greatly to the current problems, he didn&#39;t start the problems.  Bill just expanded upon legislation that already existed: the Community Reinvestment Act was passed in &#39;77 under the Carter administration.  The goal of the legislation was to force banks in poor areas to give low-interest mortgages to people who would normally be considered credit risks.  But that&#39;s not even really where this whole &quot;everyone should own a house&quot; began.<br /><br />The start of the housing problem could probably best be attributed to FDR.  In an attempt to provide some stability in the market during the great depression, FDR created Fannie Mae.  The idea, as you know, was the insure/guarantee the mortgages that banks were offering people across the country.<br /><br />So when you couple the bad policies that began by the democrats in the 70s with the bad policies that began by the democrats in 30s, you get the primary backer of mortgages across the country collapsing and bringing down the entire economy with it in 2008.  The republicans are just blamed because they&#39;re in office at the moment (which, in all honesty, is a reasonable place to start with the finger pointing in my opinion).		</div>

						So because customers were given the opportunity to complain when they thought they might be discriminated against the banks were unable to say, &quot;sorry, you should rent?&quot;  I just think too much responsibility for this mess was put on poor people and the legislation designed to help them out, when the people who are actually in control of this mess are on Wall Street.

						I&#39;d argue that looking over all the bills is just as impractical, and without doing it we&#39;ll see this failure reoccur in a decade or two, only it will be worse, and we won&#39;t have the help of the rest of the world.

						but I wanna debate the most practical solution to the problemmmmm..   lulz<br /><br />I think they should restrict short selling and hedge funds until a deal is reached.  That would limit all the really sudden changes in the market and stabalize a lot of reactionary selling and consequential. buying.  Thus giving them time to come up with a solution without having to worry about whether or not having mccain and obama at a meeting would effect the market.		</div>

						That&#39;s my preference, personally.  But I understand that many, many, many people will lose almost everything if that&#39;s allowed to happen.  But I think that this is our economy&#39;s return to sanity, and by stopping that we&#39;re doing ourselves a disservice in the long haul.		</div>

						I totally forgot bout this forum was wondering if theory (cartoon) was playing but judging by the posts It appears not. Anyways while I&#39;m here ill give an update to the latest patches which have been phenomenal. The game out of the gates was bland had alot of issues it was still in beta Ofc I knew that going in I was in the beta test. Anyways here we are 3 months later the game has come together and is looking like a game that should be released now. The early release did give it some bad rep and then eurogamer did their review sent in a retard who couldn&#39;t even figure out how to unsheathe his weapon and the whole server war&#39;d them when they sent a second guy to review well that didn&#39;t turn out well for him but it was comical seeing every clan on the server one by one declare war on them and knowing he got ganked at whatever starter city he spawned in. The latest patch made macroing skills harder but natural skill gain easier. They switched reach to be race dependent and the magic tiers were reworked to gain spells at 10 20 30 40 50 ect.. instead of 25 50 75 100. Its still a grind leveling magic but atleast your get a variety faster plus magic is supplemental, if you plan being pure caster, you plan to fail hard at darkfall. Archery is more useful than magic in small group pvp but when it comes to sieges magics aoe spells take the cake at choke points causing havoc 5 people with fireballs can decimate a dude at a choke point, however, getting 50 fire magic is no easy task its about 15-20k sulfur regs to level it to 50 prepatch dunno bout now. I don&#39;t have elemental magic yet 90+ polearms and 85 archery is doing just fine for me at the moment. One of the best changes in recent patches was enemy races show up red and allies green clan members yellowish green enemies at war orange that alone made pvp much more enjoyable. Oh they also got zoomable world map now thank god it really needed it. Anyways if anyones playing darkfall I&#39;m in a small but extremely powerful alliance (shadowbane alliance) we hold 3 cities 2 hamlets 2 of the cities are wonder capable (2 of the 7 wonder cities for 400 man alliance is remarkable). We fought against 5:1 odds with the best hired help you can buy on the other team just the other day and held out. If your playing df and looking for pvp and conquest action shoot me a pm ingame if any of you fools are playing and I&#39;ll see if I can get you in names Smoke thekind. Aight peace oh I&#39;ll prolly forget to check the forum so if you don&#39;t pm me ingame I prolly won&#39;t see your post for months and hey theory quit being a bitch I wanna teabag your corpse a few times.		</div>

I been playing it since beta thru launch til now, the game has improved quite a bit. Siege optimizations lately have been great (tho I doubt you ever went to a 600 man battle anyways so you wouldn&#39;t care/know) but the game is still highly cpu dependent and will bog down if your cpu can put out like 3.4ghz or so a huge battle may be a slideshow (gfx card is irrelevant in those situations) tho this gets improved every patch. While magic is still a bit grindy you get spells more often and you dont need 100 magic skill for magic to be useful also it levels pretty reasonably til 50 then the grind is on but at 50 you get your useful nukes so its fine.<br /><br />Also forgot to add cities do have gates now (dunno why they were left out originally). Recent patch removed the jump spin kiting with bows/magic making melee more viable you can no longer jump with a spell or bow prepped to shoot, might piss off some of the wanna be rambo solo pkers but it did a great job forcing more battlefield tactics, instead of quake deathmatch battles. <br /><br />NA server launch is due in like july I&#39;d say this paid beta will be wrapped up by then and america will get a full release not the buggy shit the last few months have been tho I&#39;ve had plenty fun in the process. Even if everything gets fixed the game still isn&#39;t for everyone, a lot of people just can&#39;t handle losing their pixels.<br /><br />P.S sorry for lack of paragraphs in the op it was 3 am and I was pretty tanked up.		</div>

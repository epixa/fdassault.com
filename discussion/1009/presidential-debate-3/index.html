						What do you guys think? I think McCain is actually winning. Which is a total shock.<br /><br />I also want to throw in there that Obama&#39;s tax plan will affect people who will lose jobs based on his corporate taxes. In other words, he plans on giving income tax cuts to people who will lose their jobs, therefore have no income to pay taxes on. We need to create jobs at a time like this, not increase the already alarming unemployment levels.		</div>

						Personally, the educational stuff is where I have a lot of knowledge and a lot of concern.<br /><br />All I have to say is they need to figure it out, pretty much.  A lot of their educational ideas are just a little off-center.  They like to push the whole certificate thing for charter and private schools, but the people that are taking advantage of it aren&#39;t low income families, who need the encouragement for their children to succeed, but the people who have kids that are doing well and probably come from middle to upper middle class families.  We really need a lot more compensatory schooling programs like Head Start, because that&#39;s the social and educational reform that&#39;s going to break the poverty cycle.<br /><br />Oh well.  I&#39;m a music teacher, and you can&#39;t put music on a standardized test, so would you like fries with that?		</div>

						IN MY OPINIONS, Mccain just looked downright bad tonight.

His health care plan doesn&#39;t limit you to spending &#36;5000.  That was the point.

						mungo: That&#39;s you know... your opinion man.  Nobody knows what the effects of either plan will truly be.  The situation now is highly volatile and different than anything we&#39;ve ever seen in this country.  McCain supporters seem to suggest that they KNOW Obama&#39;s plan will kill jobs by taxing companies&#39; incomes, but I don&#39;t hear them wondering what the effects of McCain&#39;s plans are.  If companies will be so ready to fire people because their taxes on income went up, will they just drop health care because it&#39;s being taxed as income under McCain?  If not, then why be so concerned about whether Obama&#39;s increase in taxes will lead to more unemployment?  If so, then which is worse, a bunch of unemployed people, or a bunch of sick people who can&#39;t afford sufficient health care.<br /><br />If you can only afford the 5k plan, you can&#39;t afford the deductibles for said plan.<br /><br />You&#39;re so scared of what the democrats plan might do.  Where&#39;s the (also legitimate) concern for what McCain&#39;s plans might do?  Especially considering that every 2008 nobel winner endorses Obama, and the vast majority of economists think his plan will work better.<br /><br />You know better though, right?<br /><br />/SO tired of the &quot;what about our jorbs&#33;?&quot; argument.		</div>

						Joe the plumber is an asshat by the way.<br /><br />&quot;COURIC: Well, he supposedly will raise taxes only on people who make over &#36;250,000 a year. Would you be in that category?<br /><br />WURZELBACHER: Not right now at presently, but, you know, question, so he&#39;s going to do that now for people who make &#36;250,000 a year. When&#39;s he going to decide that &#36;100,000 is too much, you know? I mean, you&#39;re on a slippery slope here. You vote on somebody who decides that &#36;250,000 and you&#39;re rich? And &#36;100,000 and you&#39;re rich? I mean, where does it end? You know, that&#39;s - people got to ask that question.&quot;<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1008/The_Joe_file.html?resubmit=1" target="_blank">good thing he&#39;s not registered to vote...</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1008/Joes_registration.html" target="_blank">edit: okay maybe he is.  But his name ain&#39;t Joe.</a>  Which I joked about with a co-worker earlier.  (next we&#39;ll find out he&#39;s not a plumber.)<br /><br />As an added note, Obama will not in fact &quot;raise taxes&quot; on people making more then 250,000.  That&#39;s the end of the tax CUTS, but tax increases only kick in after 600k.  So basically, he&#39;s ignorant on the issues and so relies on illogical arguments when confronted.  Claims to be an independent who has no dog in the race.  And in fact won&#39;t be pulling the lever for anybody on the 4th, nor has he in Ohio before.		</div>

I&#39;d like to hear something a little more substantial if you&#39;re going to keep bringing it up.<br />/ya sound like a Paulistinian dewd.</div><br /><br />How it would be better:  At the federal level, there is absolutely zero competition.  Without competition, regulation is required.  When regulation is required, self-interested lobbyists gain influence, and it only takes one person to start rocking the boat, so-to-speak.  If something like education was handled on the state level, your state would either compete or it would only attract a low income populous (uneducated or elderly), and the politicians that refused to compete with the rest of the states would be voted out in favor of politicians that want to increase education quality.  That is, unless of course the state benefits from uneducated (if its economy is based on manufacturing/farming).  And IF that is the case, any education the state does provide can be catered to what is best for that state (manufacturing/farming) as opposed to some imaginary standard that is made up and applied to every state across the entire country.<br /><br />How it could be funded:  Taxes, of course&#33;  And since it is at a state level where individual votes are far more influential, people will have more say in how their taxes are used.  Add in a proportional tax system, and you will see each state implementing policies that are truly beneficial to the majority of residents as opposed to social programs designed to &quot;help the poor&quot; at the expense of the rich.<br /><br />How to avoid corruption:  In most states, people think and vote in a large majority (that&#39;s why we have so many &quot;absolute red/blue&quot; states as opposed to 50 &quot;purple&quot; ones.  In those cases, the majority will vote out people that are fucking with their shit.  In cases like PA where the opinions and values throughout the state vary dramatically, things will either even out in one direction as the people &quot;not being heard&quot; move to a state where their values are shared or things will be far more localized as no consensus will be drawn on a state-level, so individual votes will matter even <i>more</i>.  The more localized influential voting takes place, the easier people will be able to react to corruption in their ranks.<br /><br />How much state taxes would have to raise:  That would really vary quite dramatically throughout the country, I would assume.  However, in all cases, given a proportional tax rate, taxes wouldn&#39;t raise to a point that it hurt the average joe because it&#39;s the average joe that sets the tax rate.		</div>

						Ha.  I apologize for the unintentional racism :x<br /><br />Lobbyists can and will attempt to assault state governments, but their impact is far less when the impact of the voting public is far greater.  You can&#39;t get rid of lobbyists in a democracy, but you can limit their reach and impact.  A strong federal government is a breeding ground for strong lobbyist influence.<br /><br />There&#39;s nothing wrong with states promoting specific types of businesses.  What&#39;s wrong with the credit card companies all being in one state?  That doesn&#39;t mean competition doesn&#39;t exist...<br /><br />Yes, all the good teachers would flock to states that treat them well.  That&#39;s kind of the point.<br /><br />The agricultural family is going to have a tough time getting their kids out of their agricultural society unless they move away from it entirely.  I don&#39;t really know what you&#39;re trying to argue there.<br /><br />The voting public doesn&#39;t suck at voting out incumbents, the political system is just skewed in favor of them.  The range of values varies far too much on a federal level, and no one gives two shits about their local politicians because they ultimately have no impact on their lives in our federally-ruled society.  George Bush did great things for Texas when he was governor; then he came to the federal scene and fucked everything up.  Why?  Because his views and values are inline with the Texas society and aren&#39;t inline with a lot of other people throughout the country.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to vote him out because his values appeal to slightly more people nationwide (at least in 2004) despite the fact that his values are EXTREMELY detrimental to the rest of us.		</div>

I still don&#39;t understand where the government comes into play with this, though.  Obviously you and I have radically different philosophies of government and opinions about who should be responsible for what.		</div>

						I haven&#39;t formed one that I can apply to every situation.  I believe the fed has a place as well as the state government.  Where best to apply the strengths of each system, while mitigating the weaknesses is an extremely complicated subject, especially given the bloated nature of each.  I actually agree from a fundamental perspective that yeah, state government is more efficient, and would encourage an active role from the public in the formation of the states policies.  However I am playing devils advocate by pointing out that we&#39;ve had a steadily growing federal role in our lives fro 200+ years.  We have no clue what shrinking that back down would do in our current world.  <br /><br />/The founding fathers had no idea what applying democracy would do in their world either.<br />//Sometimes bravely moving forward is really fucking awesome.<br />///Sometimes you get Zimbabwe...		</div>

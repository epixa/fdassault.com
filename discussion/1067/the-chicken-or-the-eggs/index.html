If God created the natural laws, who is to say that he couldn&#39;t change them or suspend them.  For instance, if you wrote a computer program, you have the ability to change the code and alter the program.  If it is a scripted language, you could do it on the fly.  Also, if we go back to theory on dimensions, a higher level can always access a lower level, but not the other way around.  Even if it does happen, what would be experienced at a higher level dimension would not be comprehensible by current human minds.		</div>

Also, if we go back to theory on dimensions, a higher level can always access a lower level, but not the other way around.  Even if it does happen, what would be experienced at a higher level dimension would not be comprehensible by current human minds.</div><br /><br />tl;dr version: God hates Gov, and no one cares whether the chicken or the egg came first.<br />-dan		</div>

You read a history book.  The Bible is a history book my friend.</div><br /><br />No.<br /><br />We know certain historical facts because we can back them up with attainable, physical evidence.  The christian bible is certainly shrouded in historic context, but none of the ridiculous shit that people said happened can be backed up by any legitimate scientific findings.  It&#39;s more of a lifetime &quot;inspired by real events&quot; story and, aside from the old testament, a bad one at that.<br /><br />When we read about shit that has absolutely no physical evidence to support, we call that mythology.  Atlantis anyone?<br /><br />The difference between the legitimate study of history and the christian nonsense you&#39;ve convinced yourself to be fact is the difference between the objective search for truth and the blind denial of it.<br /><br />When we find Mayan stories engraved in stone that tell about a fireball sent by the gods from heaven falling to the earth, we assume a meteor, identify the crater, and study it.  If the same (far less ludicrous story than most in the bible) story were set at the end of the old testament, christians would take it for truth and assume god was punishing the world for its sins.  And a less devout christian would say &quot;lol, we all know the old testament was just a bunch of allegories, silly -- people were just trying to explain what they didn&#39;t understand.  it was just a meteor that existed naturally but was guided to earth by the hand of god&quot;.<br /><br />Please.  There&#39;s nothing reasonable, rational or logical in what you naively hold as truth.<br /><br />Edit:  Jedd, I&#39;ll respond to your far less nonsensical but still irrational argument later.  I&#39;m afraid at the moment that your brother might have actually caused me a brain hemorrhage.<br /><br />Edit 2:  Please consider this an attack on your faith.		</div>

I&#39;m trying to say that regardless of how difficult it may be, the opportunity to interact with god must exist if he were to exist.<br /><br />And just for the sake of discussion, you&#39;re making the pretty huge assumption that the flatlander is incapable of comprehending a third dimension.  That&#39;s an assumption that doesn&#39;t hold true for human beings -- we are openly exploring the possibility of many dimensions.  Rather than arbitrarily attributing unknowns to a &quot;higher&quot; being, scientists seek out the literal truth when something is difficult to understand.		</div>

						The reason it&#39;s fair to say that flatlanders wouldn&#39;t understand what was happening was not mentioned in the post describing the event.  In flatland a square is a square is a square.  A circle is a circle is a circle.  Nothing changes in flatland, merely moves.  So when an entity appears in flatland that isn&#39;t moving, but isn&#39;t staying the same then it is something never before experienced in flatland.  It&#39;s not a flatlander, because flatlanders can&#39;t get bigger and smaller.  Human nature is to ascribe things we don&#39;t understand to the supernatural, or to try and find a natural explanation.  Millennia of experience teaches us there is almost always a good scientific explanation for things.<br /><br />Now, in flatland, I can&#39;t view or interact with other planes, other flatlands.  Correct?  That would be interacting with the higher dimension.  It&#39;s impossible.  We are subject to the whims of time, however we have no control over it.  I can&#39;t talk to a past me, or a future you.  We can see that people age, that trees grow, that the stars move through the heavens, but we can&#39;t &quot;prove&quot; time exists.  Nor can we interact with it in anything more than a passive way.<br /><br />I agree though, if something exists, then we must be able to interact with it.  So you&#39;re saying that either God doesn&#39;t exist, or he does exist and we haven&#39;t figured out how to interact with him.  Since the burden of proof is on the latter supposition, it&#39;s fair to assume that in the absence of evidence God is a fiction.  Meanwhile, isn&#39;t this conversation fun?		</div>

No.  Teleport?  No.  Vanish?  No.  Subatomic particles do it all the time though.  The laws don&#39;t apply to everything the same way.  Yeah we understand that things get wacky when shit gets REALLY small or REALLY big or REALLY fast or REALLY slow.  But since there&#39;s variation in the applicability of our previously well defined laws of reality we should be willing to assume that our laws are either poorly defined or too specific to our existence and experience to apply across the board.<br /><br />But the photon is totally working outside of our understanding of time as defined by thousands of years of recorded experience of it.  You can&#39;t send a signal faster than light speed.  So how do these two particles, separated by potentially millions of light years, know what the other is doing?  If you concede that the constraints of time and space are flexible then they really aren&#39;t &quot;constraints&quot; any more, are they?		</div>

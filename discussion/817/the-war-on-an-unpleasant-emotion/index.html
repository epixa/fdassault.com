						Just want to let you know you don&#39;t have to be afraid anymore.<br /><br />The War on Terror<br /><br />terror |&#712;ter&#601;r|<br />noun<br />1 extreme fear : people fled in terror | [in sing. ] a terror of darkness.<br />• the use of such fear to intimidate people, esp. for political reasons : weapons of terror.<br />• [in sing. ] a person or thing that causes extreme fear : his unyielding scowl became the terror of the Chicago mob.<br />• ( the Terror) the period of the French Revolution between mid 1793 and July 1794 when the ruling Jacobin faction, dominated by Robespierre, ruthlessly executed anyone considered a threat to their regime. Also called reign of terror .<br />2 (also holy terror) informal a person, esp. a child, who causes trouble or annoyance : placid and obedient in their parents&#39; presence, but holy terrors when left alone.<br /><br />So, why don&#39;t we just say: The War On Extreme Fear. That makes sense, right?<br /><br />fear |fi(&#601;)r|<br />noun<br />an unpleasant emotion caused by the belief that someone or something is dangerous, likely to cause pain, or a threat : drivers are threatening to quit their jobs in fear after a cabby&#39;s murder | fear of increasing unemployment | he is prey to irrational fears.<br />• archaic a mixed feeling of dread and reverence : the love and fear of God.<br />• ( fear for) a feeling of anxiety concerning the outcome of something or the safety and well-being of someone : police launched a search for the family amid fears for their safety.<br />• the likelihood of something unwelcome happening : she could observe the other guests without too much fear of attracting attention.<br /><br />Wait, now we find out something else here. Fear is an emotion? Holy shit, no way&#33; Well, that explains a lot to me here.<br />So we are actually fighting: The War On An Unpleasant Emotion. Ok, so what is next, the War On Smells that offend Billy Crystal? How the hell do people think that this is a good &quot;war&quot; to be fighting? Why isn&#39;t this war being fought here in the States? There was this guy today that pulled out in front of me. I felt fear for my life at that moment. Does that in fact make him a terrorist? By the New Oxford American Dictionary standards, he is. But he may just be a normal guy, that has a family and a mortgage, and job. <br /><br />Am I the only one who is upset by this? I mean, emotions never change. They are absolute, and are clear cut. I apologize for not having a point to this, but I just came to this realization laying here, and thought I would comment on it.		</div>

						Nope.  But your straw man is impressive.  I bet it feels good to knock it down.  Actually I think the soldiers acted completely within the terms of engagement.  You asked who killed more non radical Muslims.  Court says it doesn&#39;t matter, and I said I think we killed plenty of innocents.  In fact, we&#39;ve killed more innocents than Al-Qaeda did on 9-11.  Many many times more.<br /><br />There&#39;s no way to really qualify HOW they died, and we&#39;re not even interested enough in it to try and find out how MANY are dead.  But because we&#39;re there there are (in conservative estimates) just under a hundred thousand dead Iraqi civilians.<br /><br />I understand it&#39;s hard for our soldiers to make some of the choices they are forced to make every day.  The kid you rescue from a firefight might have a bomb strapped to his chest by his &quot;uncle&quot;.  blah blah.  Our soldiers are doing a hell of a job over there, and they are partly responsible for the reduced violence in the region.  (Along with the BILLIONS of dollars we&#39;ve bribed local militias with to stop shooting at Americans)<br /><br />I don&#39;t really appreciate your attitude though.  The whole &quot;fuck em&quot; thing doesn&#39;t fly so well with me.  I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what the radicals over there say about the 3k innocent Americans that died in THEIR attacks.  &quot;Collateral damage.&quot;  or &quot;They are responsible for letting things get this bad&quot; or some other such bullshit.  I&#39;m kind of offended at your dismissal of their loss by calling them fucking morons.		</div>

						How is that a dismissal of their loss?  They&#39;re morons for not stopping, just like people are morons for smoking or for driving drunk.  You KNOW that it&#39;s bad for your health, yet you do it anyway.  Not stopping at a checkpoint full of warnings, stop signs and men waving guns is stupid.  Yes, it is a shame that people have died in such a manner.  Sad for both the people that died and the soldiers that were forced to shoot them.  But being sad doesn&#39;t change the fact that the people were morons for getting themselves killed in such a way.  I&#39;d say the same thing about that drunk driver hitting a tree or the guy that chain smoked for 40 years and died of cancer.  Fucking morons.		</div>

						&quot;Plenty of &#39;tarded people go on to lead totally kick ass lives.

						deployable spike strips leaps to mind.  Are you suggesting that the only way to stop a car is to shoot it 100 times?<br /><br />Besides, we&#39;re either at war or we&#39;re not.

						That&#39;s a perfect solution ANunes.  Have our soldiers use deployable spike strips.  Spike Strips are perfect and have been used in the US for a long time.

The other 80% works about as follows - 40% the person &quot;avoids&quot; the strip, 20% the officer &quot;fails to deploy correctly&quot; and 20% the person decides he doesn&#39;t give a fuck and drives straight toward the officer deploying the strip.  I don&#39;t know why you sympathize so much with those that only want to kill our soldiers but I as a trained US soldier know that if someone with an unknown intention drives through a checkpoint, I am going to shoot to kill.

						As much as I semi-disagree with Andrew, I don&#39;t see how he&#39;s not properly defending his position. He doesn&#39;t want people to die. People are dying. People are being killed because they run a checkpoint, and how many of these people are actually terrorists? Not the majority. More importantly, what happens when they start shooting up cars filled with explosives? Good idea.<br /><br />He&#39;s simply saying that shooting the shit out of anything that doesn&#39;t completely follow your orders (American cops with tasers, anyone?) is a terrible way of going about things (It is) and there has to be an alternate solution. Just because his idea isn&#39;t perfect doesn&#39;t completely invalidate his opinions.<br /><br />Also, Respite, &quot;the moronic Obama&quot; and &quot;The Jewish liberal media&quot;? Really? Is that the best you could come up with?		</div>

If we can find a better way to guard the area until we move our troops out, lets do that, but as far as I know, this is the best we got.<br /><br />Spike strips is a good idea.  If they only work 20% of the time, you just didn&#39;t have to resort to firing at a car the times that it did work.

						Generation Kill.  Good show.  Supposed to be a great book.  <br /><br />That wasn&#39;t a real checkpoint though.  That was just a quickly made blockade of the road.<br /><br />While I can&#39;t saw for certain because I&#39;m not there, from speaking to friends of mine that have been over there, the soldiers don&#39;t just start shooting up any car that drives toward them.  They do try to give fair warning before letting loose.  If nothing else, warning shots of tracers should be a pretty clear message.<br /><br /><br />The problem with spike strips is they stop everything.  Checkpoints don&#39;t want to stop everything.  They only want to stop the cars that aren&#39;t supposed to get through, usually anything that isn&#39;t a military vehicle.  Trying to say you just deploy the spikes when a car approaches means you have to have someone outside the checkpoint to deploy them, opening them up to enemy attack.  Its a good approach, but it isn&#39;t practical.		</div>

						I&#39;ll have you know there is plenty of bush bashing going on that I don&#39;t partake in at all.  And that&#39;s the end of that reply.<br /><br />I don&#39;t have any numbers for the efficiency or accuracy with the checkpoints.  Frankly they don&#39;t really exist.  But I won&#39;t presume what they have to say.  Merely that if we&#39;re looking at 5 carbombs to 1 family then I&#39;m fine with that.  Do the best you can to minimize the risk to civilians and that&#39;s square.  If it&#39;s more like 1 to 1?  Maybe I&#39;m less keen on that then.<br /><br />Does anybody know any numbers?<br /><br />And of course my suggestion is nonsense, but it wasn&#39;t intended as a real solution, just a symbol for the investigation into better solutions than overwhelming force.		</div>

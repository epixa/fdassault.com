						Zul’Aman<br /><br />Zul&#39;Aman is a 10-player, level 70 outdoor instance located in the Ghostlands. Players will be able to confront six new bosses including the Forest Troll Warlord Zul&#39;jin.<br /><br />Guild Banks Introduced<br /><br />The Guild Bank is a shared repository for an entire guild and will be accessible through new NPC’s called guild bankers. The Guild Bank will allow players with the appropriate permissions to store items and money for use by the rest of the guild. Permissions to withdraw and deposit money and items are controlled by the guild leader through the guild controls menu. The Guild Bank is divided up into separate tabs so that the guild leader may restrict access or group items into distinct categories.<br />• Up to 6 purchasable tabs each containing 98 item slots.<br />• Permissions to view/deposit/withdraw per tab.<br />• You may use your Guild Bank withdraw limits to pay for item repairs (now enabled on all merchants).<br />• Transaction logs of the last 50 actions in the bank viewable on a per tab basis.<br /><br />General<br />• Zul’Aman<br />• Guild Banks<br />• Experience: The amount of experience needed to gain a level has been decreased between levels 20 and 60. In addition, the amount of experience granted by quests has been increased between levels 30 and 60.<br />• Expertise: We have added a new stat and associated rating called expertise and expertise rating. Expertise rating converts to expertise at the same rate that weapon skill rating formerly converted at. Each point of expertise reduces the chance for your attacks to be dodged or parried by 0.25%.<br />• Healing reduction effects will now affect all health drain spells and abilities (e.g. Mortal Strike will reduce health gained from Drain Life).<br />• Healing: Almost all items and enchantments that provide bonus healing now also provide a smaller number (approximately 1/3) of bonus spell damage. There are a few items and enchantments where this was not possible, such as random-stat items and Zul&#39;Gurub enchantments, but this is now the case on virtually all other items.<br />• On Kill Effects: Items and abilities that trigger on killing an enemy will no longer trigger on using an ability that kills your pet.<br />• Weapon Skill: All items and abilities that granted weapon skill have been changed. In most cases, they were converted to expertise or expertise rating. Ranged attacks do not benefit from expertise, so ranged weapon skill has generally been replaced by critical strike bonuses or hit bonuses. In a few cases, talents have been changed to other effects to avoid granting players excessive amounts of expertise.<br />• A new flight path has been added to the Rebel Camp in northern Stranglethorn Vale.<br />• Flying units can see ground units and vice versa at any altitude.<br />• Players no longer gain the moving AOE radius bonus if they are jumping.<br />• Client spell cast requests are now sent to the server even if your player is already casting another spell. This eliminates the need for /stopcasting in macros to compensate for latency.<br />• Vendor Discounts: All vendors with an associate faction now give discounts at all levels above neutral.<br />o Friendly: 5% discount<br />o Honored: 10% discount<br />o Revered: 15% discount<br />o Exalted: 20% discount<br />• Quest givers who have available daily quests will have a blue exclamation point instead of a yellow one.<br />• Pets will try to get behind their targets when engaging in melee combat.<br /><br />Racial Abilities<br />• Dwarf: Gun Specialization now increases chance to critically hit with Guns by 1% rather than increasing weapon skill.<br />• Gnome: Escape Artist cooldown increased to 1 min, 45 sec.<br />• Troll: Bow and Thrown Specialization now increases chance to critically hit with those weapons by 1% rather than increasing weapon skill.<br /><br />PvP<br />Arenas<br />• The top ranked team of each battlegroup for each format will receive a new unique title for the end of Season 2 called “Merciless Gladiator”.<br />Battlegrounds<br />• Daily quests have been added targeting a random battleground for that day. Look for Alliance Brigadier Generals and Horde Warbringers near your faction&#39;s battlemasters in all major capitals.<br />• Dropping the Flag in a battleground will now result in a debuff that will not allow you to pick up the flag again for 3 seconds.<br />• Druids who are shapeshifted when they receive the Restoration buff from battlegrounds will now correctly regenerate mana.<br />• Players will now be able to cast spells for free in the Battleground before it begins.<br />• Players will now be able to cast spells for free for a few seconds after being resurrected by a Spirit Guide in the Battleground.<br />• Alterac Valley<br />• Additional Warmasters no longer report for duty upon destroying an enemy tower. However, destroying an enemy tower still eliminates the associated opposing Warmaster.<br />• All Warmasters are linked to each other and their respective Generals and can no longer be pulled individually.<br />• Honor from capturing towers has been increased.<br />• All Commanders and Lieutenants have left Alterac Valley in search for other battle opportunities.<br />• Players will no longer be sent to their starting tunnels on death unless that team controls no graveyards in the battleground.<br />• Many NPCs in Stormpike and Frostwolf holds are no longer elite<br />• Bonus Honor in Alterac Valley is now only awarded during the battle for destroying enemy towers and slaying the enemy Captain. Upon conclusion of the battle, bonus honor is also awarded for intact towers, a surviving Captain, and for victory in the battle. The total bonus honor awarded should be similar to the previous total.<br />• The Horde and Alliance now have a limited number of reinforcements available in the battle for Alterac Valley. The number of reinforcements available is reduced upon player death, loss of towers, and death of Captain Galvangar or Balinda Stonehearth. In addition, all available reinforcements are lost upon the death of General Drek&#39;Thar or Vanndar Stormpike. If a team is reduced to zero reinforcements, the opposing team wins the battle.<br />• Towers and Graveyards in Alterac Valley are now captured in 4 minutes (down from 5).<br />Eye of the Storm<br />• The points awarded from capturing the flag in Eye of the Storm is now increase based on the number of bases the capturing team owns.<br />Warsong Gulch, Arathi Basin, Eye of the Storm<br />• Additional bonus honor is now awarded upon conclusion of the battle.<br /><br />Druids<br />• Barkskin: It is no longer possible to cast this spell while Cycloned.<br />• Cure Poison and Abolish Poison are now usable in Tree of Life Form.<br />• Cure Poison, Abolish Poison and Remove Curse range increased to 40 yards.<br />• Entangling Roots: It is no longer possible for multiple Druids to have Entangling Roots on the same target. In addition, it will now always be removed correctly if multiple Druids overwrite each other’s Entangling Roots.<br />• Feral Attack Power: Items that granted bonus attack power in Cat, Bear, Dire Bear, and Moonkin forms have been re-evaluated. In almost all cases, the attack power on the item has been increased. This change corrects an issue where feral weapon damage was not keeping up with other classes in its rate of increase.<br />• Force of Nature: This ability will no longer automatically break stealth on victims in its casting area. Nearby stealthed characters may still be attacked if they are too close to the summoned Treants.<br />• Heart of the Wild: This talent no longer provides 4/8/12/16/20% bonus Strength in Cat Form. Instead it provides 2/4/6/8/10% bonus attack power.<br />• Hibernate: This spell will now always be removed correctly if multiple Druids overwrite each other’s Hibernate.<br />• Intensity (Restoration) increased to 10/20/30% mana regeneration.<br />• Primal Fury: This talent will now be learned correctly even if purchased while the Druid is dead.<br />• Rebirth cooldown reduced to 20 minutes, from 30 minutes.<br />• Remove Curse is now usable in Moonkin Form.<br />• Shapeshifting Spells: Some of these spells were causing additional unintended threat. That additional unintended threat has been removed.<br />• Soothe Animal: This spell now properly consumes Nature’s Swiftness.<br />• Tranquility now gains additional benefit from spell damage and healing bonuses.<br /><br />Hunters<br />• Arcane Shot (Ranks 6 and above) now dispel 1 Magic effect in addition to their normal damage.<br />• Explosive Trap: The initial damage dealt by this trap is now also increased by 10% of your ranged attack power.<br />• Immolation Trap: The total damage dealt by this trap is now also increased by 10% of your ranged attack power.<br />• Misdirection: This spell will now always be removed correctly if multiple Hunters overwrite each other’s Misdirection.<br />• Readiness: This talent now finishes the cooldown on Kill Command.<br />• Serpent Sting, Immolation Trap and Explosive Trap all gain additional damage based on ranged attack power.<br />• Serpent Sting: The total damage dealt by this sting is now also increased by 10% of your ranged attack power.<br />• Steady Shot: Tooltip clarified to indicate base weapon damage is used in the damage calculation.<br />• Trueshot Aura (Marksmanship) no longer costs mana to cast and will last until cancelled.<br />• Wyvern Sting (Survival) is now instant cast and has a maximum duration of 10 seconds in PvP.<br /><br />Mages<br />• Arcane Intellect and Arcane Brilliance mana costs reduced.<br />• Arcane Meditation (Arcane) increased to 10/20/30% mana regeneration.<br />• Arcane Missiles: Players will no longer get strange error messages when casting this spell at evading targets. The spell will simply fail.<br />• Detect Magic removed. All players may now see their target&#39;s beneficial effects at all times.<br />• Evocation now regenerates 15% of total mana every 2 seconds rather than increase Spirit based regeneration.<br />• Fire Ward and Frost Ward now gain additional benefit from spell damage bonuses. Base absorb values of ranks 5 and 6 have been reduced.<br />• Hypothermia duration increased to 45 sec.<br />• Ice Barrier now gains additional benefit from spell damage bonuses. Base absorb values of ranks 5 and 6 have been reduced.<br />• Improved Fireball: The reduction in damage coefficient caused by this talent has been removed.<br />• Improved Frostbolt: The reduction in damage coefficient caused by this talent has been removed.<br />• Polymorph: It is no longer possible to polymorph a player and have that player remain mounted. In addition, it will now always be removed correctly if multiple Mages overwrite each other’s Polymorph.<br />• Portal Spells: Portal spells to capital cities can no longer be cast in battlegrounds.<br />• Remove Curse range increased to 40 yards.<br />• (NEW SPELL) Ritual of Refreshment available on trainers at level 70.<br />• Spellsteal: It is no longer possible via this spell to get two Forbearance debuffs at the same time.<br /><br />Paladins<br />• Blessing of Light: Lower ranks of Flash of Light and Holy Light are now properly penalized when used with this Blessing.<br />• Cleanse and Purify range increased to 40 yards.<br />• Crusader Strike (Retribution) cooldown reduced from 10 to 6 seconds.<br />• Divine Favor: When this ability is cast immediately after a critical heal, it will no longer be removed incorrectly.<br />• Exorcism mana cost reduced.<br />• Fanaticism (Retribution) now also reduces threat caused by all actions by 6/12/18/24/30%.<br />• Hammer of Wrath mana cost reduced.<br />• Holy Wrath mana cost reduced.<br />• Improved Seal of the Crusader (Retribution) benefits folded into the base spell. This talent now gives the benefits of the Sanctified Crusader talent instead.<br />• To: Judgement of Light: The combat log will now show the health gained from rank 5 of this ability as Judgement of Light instead of Seal of Light.<br />• Precision (Protection) now increases spell hit chance as well.<br />• Pursuit of Justice (Retribution) is now 3 ranks and increases movement speed by 5/10/15% and also reduces the chance you&#39;ll be hit by spells by 1/2/3%.<br />• Sanctified Crusader (Retribution) renamed Sanctified Seals, which now increases your chance to critically hit with all spells and melee attacks by 1/2/3% and reduces the chance your Seals will be dispelled by 33/66/100%.<br />• Seal of Vengeance: The bonus damage this ability dealt when the debuff is fully stacked on the target was incorrectly too low. It is now increased.<br />• Spiritual Attunement: This ability will now gain mana properly from Vampiric Embrace heals.<br />• Vengeance (Retribution) duration increased from 15 to 30 seconds.<br />• Vindication (Retribution) frequency and duration increased and now reduces all attributes by 5/10/15%, not just Strength and Agility.<br />• Weapon Expertise (Protection) renamed Combat Expertise, now increases expertise by 1/2/3/4/5 and total Stamina by 2/4/6/8/10%.<br /><br />Priests<br />• Chastise (NEW) is now available to Dwarf and Draenei priests at level 20.

						Was doing 5s with my weekly 1550s team at like 4 am.  We played this team from my server like 5 times in a row.   The first 2 times we got rolled.  We all were on vent and we made a REALLY elaborate plan and put it into action. We destroyed them on try 3, got 25 points for the win, smoked them agian try 4 for about 23 points; they switched out two players and we rolled them on the 5th try for like 21 points.  We armoried them, and found out we dropped their rated from like 1700 to 1625, and yes they were mostly 2/5 or 3/5 merciless, so it wasn&#39;t a purchased team.		</div>

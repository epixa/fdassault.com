Wait a few minutes for your turn to come up again and repeat. There&#39;s a history bar on the right so people can see what has happened if they need to. I think you get a maximum of 3 minutes for each turn??<br /><br />For those who can&#39;t participate in the draft, Yahoo will auto-pick for you based on how you have players ranked. You may think that&#39;s a crappy way to draft, but the auto-pick usually results in a very balanced team from what I remember in the past.</div><br /><br />Let&#39;s see.  9:30 PM, 3 minutes per pick, 14 teams, 17 rounds...<br /><br />At least we can guarantee the draft will be over before I go to work...  Oh... wait...<br /><br />11 hours 54 minutes... <br /><br />Awesome...  Thanks for the assurance that this is a reasonable time to hold a draft on a weekday.<br /><br />Move it to a weekend.  We are having it at this time to suit one person.  I find it difficult to believe that nobody else has to work the next morning and would rather it be at least an hour earlier even if it means moving days... <br /><br />But maybe I&#39;m wrong, in which case I&#39;m out.		</div>

I&#39;m ok with 8, or even 8:30, but you&#39;re really fucking everyone who has to work in the morning by making it any later than that.

						And Saturday *anytime* works.  Sunday I have another draft in the evening.<br />More specifically, any single day except 9/7 (another draft) I can do it no problems if it&#39;s before 8:30.  Weekends can be whatever, though I&#39;m still not keen on starting any later than 10:00.<br /><br />Maybe y&#39;all draft absurdly fast, but all of my drafts have taken at least an hour and a half, and in leagues of &gt;12 teams that bumps way up really quickly.  14 teams, 17 rounds = 238 picks.  For that to take less than an hour, every pick would have to occur in less than 15 seconds.<br /><br />I&#39;m not that optimistic.		</div>

Yahoo will auto-draft that individual&#39;s next highest player. That means well over 100 selections should take a second (or less) for the computer to select. Usually the people signed on know who they&#39;re going to select as well, meaning the full 3 minutes rarely gets used -- in years past it has taken about an hour to get through a draft.<br /><br />I posted my schedule and am still fine with whatever day and time we end up with. I&#39;ll try (and want) to make it, but if you land on a time that doesn&#39;t work then I&#39;m cool with Yahoo auto-picking for me. Like I said above, it would be nice to just settle on a time so I can figure out if/how to fit a draft into my schedule.		</div>

						For the record, it is entirely unreasonable to say that an <i>entire weekend</i> of a borderline-holiday at best such as labor day is off limits for something like this.  If you seriously cannot schedule a few hours of time anywhere in the weekend, then good for you, but that is _completely_ your fault and not at all normal.  It is LABOR day for christs sake, and it is ONLY on monday to boot.  If you couldn&#39;t do it on Sunday evening because you were at a BBQ, then fine.  If you were going on vacation that weekend, that is fine too.  But other than that, what the _fuck_ else could you possibly be doing that would occupy 100% of your time and could not possibly be adjusted for the slightest bit to allow you to dedicate half of your attention to a computer for two hours?  Jesus christ... and you rag on Andrew for having sand in his vagina?		</div>

My challenge to you is to rationally explain why your restriction on weekends is any more reasonable than Andrew&#39;s.  His restriction is due to work-productivity, yours seems to be due to a personal weekend-luddite thing, so some rationalization would definitely go a long way in helping me understand.<br /><br />I would say that exactly zero percent of the people that I know are going to be out of town for the entire labor day weekend.  Well, I guess that isn&#39;t accurate anymore, since you will be.  So much less than 1% of the people that I know will be out of town all labor day weekend.  Assuming this statistic is meaningless to you (which I&#39;m sure it is), then you can see why you saying that 50% of the people you know are vacating town for three days is pretty meaningless to me.		</div>

						Well, I for one will most likely auto pick anyway. I haven&#39;t been keeping on football at all.

I hope that the ones pitching a fit are all seeing the ridiculousness of what they are saying.		</div>

						I forget what all happened and am too lazy to re-read but it seemed like a decent amount of people were okay with Wednesday or Thursday evening until Andrew complained about having to stay up late. Which pretty much rules out drafting any time during the weekday because of the time difference. So his one request knocks out 5 days, instead of the 2 that are knocked out by avoiding the weekend. Even worse though, is that it seems by having it on a weekend less people will be able to make it (Phey and Mungo...I&#39;m a maybe depending on the day that&#39;s picked - haven&#39;t heard from anyone else). <br /><br />That&#39;s were my frustration is coming from -- changing the time to accomodate one request that ends up displacing more people. Also, the &quot;obvious&quot; joke wasn&#39;t too obvious to me -- telling someone to bro up after just getting done complaining about having to stay up an hour is the definition of hypocrisy to me. He makes a valid point in that Phey may have the choice to attend a wedding or not, but at the same time Andrew has the choice to miss the draft himself, stay up late and &quot;bro up&quot; himself, or figure out an alternate work schedule for that day (like I may end up doing).<br /><br />Whatever though, here&#39;s when I&#39;m available:<br /><br />9/1 through 9/3 -- Anytime after 5 pm EST<br />9/4 -- Anytime (hopefully)<br />9/5 -- Not available at all<br />9/6 -- Anytime after noon EST<br />9/7 through 9/10 -- Anytime after 5 pm EST<br /><br />I&#39;d also suggest perhaps the winner from last year be able to pick the time slot that suits them best. Or perhaps the top 3 finishers decide amongst themselves to choose a time. That way there&#39;s somewhat of a &quot;prize&quot; for those who did well last year. Last year Blacklight took first, Buckeye took 2nd and KP took 3rd. Since Buckeye isn&#39;t in it this year -- maybe KP and Blacky should pick a time that works for them and go from there.		</div>

						I just got done &quot;participating&quot; in two mock drafts through Yahoo. Participating is in quotes because I didn&#39;t make the picks myself, but rather had Yahoo auto-select for me and then email me the results. I wanted to see how long the draft would take, and what I could expect to end up with if unable to attend the draft and had to rely on Yahoo. I received the email results from both drafts just under an hour from when they started, and am pretty pleased with the results:<br /><br />Mock Draft 1 (draft position 11 out of 14)<br />1. Ryan Mathews (SD - RB) <br />2. Reggie Wayne (Ind - WR) <br />3. Beanie Wells (Ari - RB) <br />4. Philip Rivers (SD - QB) <br />5. Santana Moss (Was - WR) <br />6. Mike Wallace (Pit - WR) <br />7. Heath Miller (Pit - TE) <br />8. Pittsburgh (Pit - DEF) <br />9. Josh Scobee (Jac - K) <br />10. Thomas Jones (KC - RB) <br />11. Julian Edelman (NE - WR) <br />12. Devin Thomas (Was - WR) <br />13. Josh Johnson (TB - QB) <br />14. Benjamin Watson (Cle - TE) <br />15. Jay Feely (Ari - K) <br /><br />Mock Draft 2 (draft position 5 out of 14)<br />1. Michael Turner (Atl - RB) <br />2. Calvin Johnson (Det - WR) <br />3. Pierre Thomas (NO - RB) <br />4. Chad Ochocinco (Cin - WR) <br />5. Brett Favre (Min - QB) <br />6. Jason Witten (Dal - TE) <br />7. Robert Meachem (NO - WR) <br />8. Minnesota (Min - DEF) <br />9. Garrett Hartley (NO - K) <br />10. Jerome Harrison (Cle - RB) <br />11. John Carlson (Sea - TE) <br />12.

						This is insane. LOL I have been doing fantasy football since all of your asses were still in diapers. (18 yearthis year) I ran a league with a buddy and am helping my brother-in-law run one this year. I am in two differet leagues and one is through yahoo, every draft I have ever been in has been on sunday starting either 1 pm or 3 pm and done in no longer then 3 hours. If someone couldn&#39;t make it cause of work or fmily obligations a good friend or brother was sent in place to do it for them. The fact not one of you has thought of letting someone else fill in for you actually makes me laugh. I sent my dad one year cause my ex was going into false labor at the time. All the talk of weekdays being the best is well wrong. Look at fos, cbs, yahoo, sportning news, espn OVER 80% of drafts are on weekends. if you ave to take a weekday then the pro of time zones comes in and you have to say ok I can&#39;t do weekends so I have to make myself avail for the guy in california. If that means you get up at 3 am so he can be in after work well you have to be willing to do that if YOUR the one or ones throwing the weekend out. <br /><br /><br /><br />END OF RANT (i think)<br /><br />Rogue. (red devils on yahoo ff). <br />		</div>

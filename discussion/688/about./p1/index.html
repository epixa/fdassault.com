						Well, it is an MMO, so I don&#39;t think we need to explain that too much.  Instead, I&#39;ll explain how it is different from most other MMOs.<br /><br />There are three &quot;factions&quot; that consist of varying races, but you are not restricted in your interactions with other races.  Clans can consist of any races, and you can trade with any races as well.  However, you run into issues with NPCs in major urban areas when your race isn&#39;t on friendly terms with the city&#39;s primary race.  Thus, while interacting with your &quot;enemy&quot; races is possible, it is difficult to accomplish.<br /><br />There are no levels, but there are skills that you need to increase through practice in order to improve your damage and such with the weapons and spells that you utilize.<br /><br />There are no classes; you can choose to learn any combination of skills including all of them.  Your gear will largely affect which areas of your skill-sets will be effective at any given time.<br /><br />Combat is real-time.  You cannot simply select an enemy and auto attack.  Whether you are fighting melee, ranged, or with spells, you need to aim your attacks and in most cases the location/hitbox that you land on will affect the amount of damage that you did.  Ranged attacks are also aimed and have no maximum range other than what the world&#39;s physics will allow (gravity will bring most arrows/spells to the ground over time).  You simply never have to (and possibly cannot) select other players, so the traditional way to do combat and such is out the window.<br /><br />There are no names over people&#39;s heads or anything, but there are no crazy things like &quot;stealth mode&quot; that you see in games like WoW.  You can be stealthy all you&#39;d like, but it is up to your talent as a player to accomplish it.<br /><br />When you die, you lose everything you carry (there are some universal banks though, so its not like you have to lose everything you own), so while gear is beneficial, you risk losing any awesome gear you get if you make a stupid decision in combat.  At the same time, a good player can gain quite a deal from their successes in battle.<br /><br />Collision is very real.  If a line of people is standing in a doorway, you will not be able to get through that doorway unless you can push them out of the way or fight through them.  This obviously brings a fresh dynamic to combat that you usually don&#39;t see outside of FPSs.<br /><br />Friendly fire is a real threat at all times.  Any attack (melee, ranged, spell) has the possibility of causing 100% damage to friendly units if not aimed correctly.<br /><br />Horses are in the game and can be used during combat and everything.  They can also be killed.<br /><br />Boats exist as does full naval warfare.<br /><br />The world is bigger than any other MMO world out there.  One estimate says it would take about 8 hours to run across the main continent.<br /><br />Clans can build cities and empires.  Most (if not all) of the land is conquerable, so clan warfare will probably be quite common.<br /><br />There will be some PvE and quests and such if you want to follow that path, but there will not be instances.<br /><br />Basically, the game is extremely flexible and aims to give the player complete freedom to do whatever they want.  There is reputation to help make sure really dishonorable players have a tougher time than others, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it won&#39;t be extremely rewarding to the people that can make dishonor work for them.		</div>

Kudos to you&#33; I can&#39;t think of really much of anything to add. Maybe that the economy is entirely player driven... So all the items, weapons, and armor and such are crafted from players, not bought from vendors. My understanding is there are some item drops, but there wont be any &quot;uuber gear&quot; like you see in raids in WoW and such.		</div>

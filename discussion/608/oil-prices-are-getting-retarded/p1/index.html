						So today I&#39;ve read 3 articles about rising oil prices.  All breaking news.<br /><br />1. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2008-04/21/content_6630888.htm" target="_blank">OPEC Security-General Abdullah el al-Badri: &quot;Oil prices, there is a common understanding that has nothing to do with supply and demand&quot;</a><br /><br />2. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/04/21/business/main4029833.shtml?source=RSSattr=HOME_4029833" target="_blank">Oil prices rise after rocket attack on Japanese oil tanker</a><br /><br />3. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/O/OIL_PRICES?SITE=KYB66&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT" target="_blank">Oil hits &#36;117</a><br /><br />So basically the message I&#39;m getting is this:<br />If supply goes down, price goes up.  There is not a supply problem.  If demand goes up then the strain on supply causes prices to rise.  If demand goes down, then the strain on profits goes up and the prices rise.  So maybe al-Badri is right and it has nothing to do with supply and demand.  So what are the factors that do contribute?  Current events.  If something is in the news that can be perceived as detrimental to the oil industry, the oil industry can raise prices and we can&#39;t say anything about it because we need the oil.  Not necessarily news, but seeing these three things basically side by side in the business section really ticked me off.		</div>

						you&#39;ve got most of it...maybe there was more to what al-Badri was saying (china ftw). There are a shitload of factors that affect prices: consumer supply and demand, crude oil supply, refinery disruptions, pipeline issues, etc. He&#39;s right in that there is no oil shortage; the common misconception is caused because most people don&#39;t know or don&#39;t acknowledge the difference between proven and unproven oil reserves.<br /><br />In the industry we use &quot;P90&quot; to describe &quot;proven reserves&quot;, i.e. &quot;we have 90% confidence that we can produce xxx barrels according to our research, modeling, etc&quot;. P50 cases are classified as &quot;probable reserves&quot;, and P10 cases are &quot;possible&quot;. The proven reserves is already a large number, and it doesn&#39;t even include anything less than P50 cases. So as current technologies like SAGD, VAPEX, CSS, etc. improve, the reserves estimate will rise and cut production costs, lessening the strain on the market. (assuming the govt doesn&#39;t fuck us with carbon emissions bullshit and royalties)		</div>

						The confusion isn&#39;t on his end.  His language was just inaccurate.  My basic problem with the oil industry is that the amount of rampant speculation involved in setting the price of something that should really be considered a commodity is out of control.  They are no longer required to give real reasons because of all the ammunition they have accumulated over the years.  <br /><br />1) Instability in oil producing regions<br />2) Instability in transportation of oil<br />3) Disruptions in refineries<br />4) Disruptions in tankers<br />All contribute to the supply of oil.  Directly.  Having a busted pipeline doesn&#39;t inherently make oil cost more.  It makes oil harder to come by for a bit and people charge more for it as a result.  The market always has and always will boil down to those 2 factors exclusively.  Supply.  And Demand.  <span>except oil</span>		</div>

						i think for one of the world&#39;s biggest businesses, something that happens today, shouldn&#39;t have any affect today...i feel like this is backlash from months ago.<br /><br />who knows.<br /><br /><br />ALSO: i think once george bush is out of office, the gas situation will get under control.  if he cuts budget for fuel, it&#39;s coming out of his pocket.<br /><br />i think there are many things people can do to remove the stress of the rising gas prices:<br /><br /><br />1. make sure your car is maintained: (tire pressure, oil changes on time are both crucial to getting the most from your cars fuel)  people with older cars, make sure they&#39;ve had a tuneup within the last 20-30 thousand miles.  a tune up can run you 100 bucks at a garage but can save you a lot more if your car is running efficient.<br /><br />2. if you know someone that drives a gmc yukon denali, punch them square in the junk until they realize they&#39;re useless and you no longer value them as a friend.<br /><br />3. don&#39;t feed into these useless chain emails/facebook groups.  picking and choosing which gas company you buy from isn&#39;t going to do shit.  not buying gas on a certain day isn&#39;t going to do shit.		</div>

						The attacks on one of Nigeria&#39;s pipelines temporarily slowed the transport of 169k barrels per day in the country occurred this weekend.  So not quite today, but not weeks old either.<br /><br />And the point isn&#39;t that we are a gas hungry nation.  Though that&#39;s true and there are a lot of things including those that we can do to help change that, there is no evidence that if we were to decrease our dependence on oil that prices would go down.  On the contrary, smaller demand is the reason that oil jumped above 115 a couple days ago.  Smaller demand = smaller profits = higher prices = same price at the pump overall...<br /><br />My problem with all of this is that we&#39;re being toyed with by an industry and I frankly think they are raising prices because we can&#39;t stop them and all they have to do is watch current events and emphasize the ones that have effects on their business.<br /><br />Also <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/gasoline-refiners-slow-output-rate/story.aspx?guid={6634214A-A8E7-423F-9A0A-C5119FC8661C}" target="_blank">this</a> is a problem.  Oil refineries aren&#39;t making enough money apparently and so they need to slow production to lower their overhead.  This will also drive up prices because supply will drop, increasing the profitability of the refineries, allowing them to increase production again.... I guess.<br /><br />edit 2:<br />I also think it&#39;s fishy that oil companies like Exxon are posting record profits, but gas refineries are posting losses.		</div>

						the hardline is the two-headed dildo of the weakening dollar and crude oil prices man. A near infinite supply of anything isn&#39;t gonna matter much if your currency&#39;s worth dick all, ask any german. It is also significantly more technically difficult and time consuming to extract oil from reservoirs, as well as processing, compared to a few decades ago. Political instability, facilities disruptions, consumer demand, and all that other shit contribute to minor or short term fluctuations. I don&#39;t think speculation has much, if anything, to do with it. There is no 9/11 conspiracy. And i&#39;m not just saying that because i work in the industry. <img src="src" alt="image" />/smile.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid=":)" border="0" alt="smile.gif" /&gt; And even if you, the consumer, makes a conscious effort to &quot;decrease your dependence on oil&quot;, how much do you really think you could cut? Enough to offset worldwide demand (esp. China)?		</div>

						I&#39;m not proposing any sort of conspiracy.  At least not in a real capacity.  But to say that speculation has nothing to do with it seems a bit nitpicky.  All those factors are all speculations by nature.  Oh, this country we get oil from happens to have trouble brewing.  We speculate this will make oil harder to get.  And should therefore be more expensive, not for us to buy, but for us to sell.  Every distributor of oil has a stockpile of their own, and they price that stockpile based on what could be going on in the world around them in the near future.<br /><br />Plus our dollar isn&#39;t really worth dick all yet.  And oil prices are rising around the world, not just here.  I didn&#39;t mean to sound as crank-pot-y as I did, but if anyone here doesn&#39;t think that the goal of oil companies isn&#39;t to increase profits then they don&#39;t understand how corporations work.  And they&#39;ve found a really easy way to increase profits that almost no other industry can leverage.  They simply raise the price.  If this were ANYTHING but oil we&#39;d be crying foul.<br /><br />Whether they have good reasons or not, I think it&#39;s important that we not stop questioning their validity.		</div>

						I agree that the main problem is the weakening dollar.  <br /><br />I just can&#39;t understand why the consumers feel it, but the oil companies are making record profits.  If the oil was getting more expensive, and the oil companies just passed the increase to the consumer, the oil companies shouldn&#39;t be making record profits.  It doesn&#39;t make sense, unless they are raising the price up beyond the increase of the oil.<br /><br />Now, I may just not understand the complexities of the oil/gasoline business, but the way I understand business, if the costs of producing your product goes up, you aren&#39;t expecting to post record profits.		</div>

						That would definitely reduce the overhead for the refineries which would eliminate one of the troubles.  And yeah, if I can drive my PA car to Arizona and get gas there and have it still work, but the refinery had to make it special...

						I refrained from that comparison because it&#39;s apples and oranges.  We know our money is worth less when it is worth less compared to other money.  You&#39;re adding another variable.  The prices of those goods and/or services fluctuates not only based on the free market but ALSO based on the value of money.  You can&#39;t possibly get an accurate idea of how much the dollar is worth that way.<br /><br />Oh, and this means gas prices should go down right?

						I suggested to use the comparison that I did, because that was what I was taught in economics class.  And it isn&#39;t a perfect measurement, but it tends to demonstrate the value of the dollar.  If &#36;3 could feed a family fifty years ago, but it takes &#36;20 today.  We can effectively see the amount the dollar has fallen.<br /><br />I agree that the British Pound and the Euro are decent markers, because of how stable they have been.

						That doesn&#39;t work anymore.  It worked great with gold when gold WAS the standard.  But there seriously isn&#39;t a standard today.  The value of gold is variable on too many levels.  The STRENGTH of a currency, IMO is best represented as it&#39;s strength relative to the rest of the world.  Here&#39;s a hypothetical example:<br /><br />2000: Item X costs &#36;1/each and 1 Euro/each<br />2010: Item X costs &#36;2/each and 3 Euro/each<br />The dollar is stronger even though it buys less of the item, because the value of the item has also increased as dictated by the world market.<br /><br />2000: Item X costs &#36;1/each and 1 Euro/each<br />2010: Item X costs &#36;2/each and 1 Euro/each<br />The dollar is weaker because the item isn&#39;t worth more anywhere but here, indicating that the increased cost is a direct result in the value of our money, rather than simple market fluctuations.<br /><br />It&#39;d be really nice if things were as simple as they were in the 1800&#39;s when our money cost less to produce than it was worth, and it was a symbol of something real, and was only traded internally in the country.<br />		</div>

It doesn&#39;t take in any single item as its standard.  You can use one item, but that won&#39;t calculate the inflation properly.  You have to use a variety of items.<br /><br />And the problem you state for using commodities as a measurement may also apply to use of currency.<br /><br />2000: Item X costs &#36;1/each and 1 Euro/each<br />2010: Item X costs &#36;2/each and 3 Euro/each<br /><br />In 2000, the currency could be considered about equal.  In 2010, maybe item X has changed, but the currencies may have changed as well.  Maybe the dollar fell, but the Euro fell further.  Maybe the item&#39;s value increased, the dollar increased and the Euro stayed the same.  Maybe the Euro fell slightly, and the dollar didn&#39;t change one bit, but item X&#39;s cost increased.<br /><br />The only way I know to measure currency is by what it buys.		</div>

						idk.  I said nicer but I meant easier.  I don&#39;t know enough to say that I think these kinds of changes would actually help at all.

And OPEC seems to think that increased oil prices are a result of the weakening dollar, saying that if the dollar&#39;s value were to fall 1%, then the cost of oil would rise &#36;4/barrel.  Conversely if the value of the dollar were to rise that 10% then the cost would drop by 40%<br /><br />40% of &#36;120 is &#36;48...  <br />1% fall... &#36;4 increase.  <br />10% rise...&#36;48 decrease.

It&#39;s more profitable for most farmers to grow crops for Ethanol production at this point in time than it is for them to actually grow food.  Which means we&#39;ve decreased production of foodstuffs for the purpose of eating it while demand for food is largely unchanged(if not growing)... Which in turn has increased the cost of many types of food. Another one that many people in here may have noticed is that beer is costing more to buy now. Seems a lot of Hops growers have switched to supplying Ethanol producers instead, causing the price of Hops to go up, which is being passed on to the consumer in the form of beer costing more.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22808209/" target="_blank">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22808209/</a><br /><br />It&#39;s also going to start hitting other parts of the food industry as well, as chicken feed, feeding cattle, etc is becoming more expensive because its more profitable for Farmers to grow crops in support of Ethanol production than it is for them to grow that stuff.		</div>

						You saved yourself with that &quot;perceived&quot;.  There is no real shortage atm.  What&#39;s annoying about this is that your still right.  They can use the perceived supply problems as leverage for price increases.  So they do.  It&#39;s dick.  I&#39;d be interested in seeing some data about the increased demand in IndoChina.  I bet it&#39;s a really small percentage.  Both nations were pretty well industrialized and had airports, shipping ports, etc.  Cars contribute so little to the overall carbon footprint.  Though the sizes of the populations might make the difference.  I&#39;m too lazy to look it up atm.  Maybe later.		</div>

I&#39;d be interested in seeing some data about the increased demand in IndoChina.  I bet it&#39;s a really small percentage.  Both nations were pretty well industrialized and had airports, shipping ports, etc.  Cars contribute so little to the overall carbon footprint.  Though the sizes of the populations might make the difference.  I&#39;m too lazy to look it up atm.

The U.S. consumed the most oil — 20.6 million barrels per day in 2006 — but China is playing a quick catch-up at 7.3. Other countries consuming large amounts of oil are Japan at 5.2, Russia at 3.1, Germany at 2.6, and India at 2.5 million barrels a day. The world as a whole consumes 86 million barrels a day and 31 billion barrels a year.<br /><br />“The world economy has been growing at a pretty good clip,” Baker says. “As a result, oil demand has remained high in the oil-hungry United States while it has been increasing sharply in developing countries like China and India.”<br /><br />In February alone oil demand by China rose 6.2 percent, exceeding the 3.3 percent rise in January and the 3.5 percent increase for all of 2007.</div><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/China/Oil.html" target="_blank">http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/China/Oil.html</a><br /><br />Shows 4.8 Million Barrels per day of oil consumption in China in 2000... Which puts the 2006 numbers (7.356 million barrels per day) at 52% higher than their rate of consumption in 2000.<br /><br />Add another 3.5% on top of that for 2007(sandia&#39;s numbers) and we&#39;re up to 7.613 million barrels per day for China, or a 58.6% increase in demand for Oil in China since 2000...

And that what I presume the CIA&#39;s 2006 numbers were(which is what I think you cited) was a level of demand that DoE&#39;s numbers indicate was reached sometime between 2004 and 2005. So if I had to guess, it seems that the CIA numbers are running about a year behind the DoE numbers for some reason.<br /><br />Edit: Or another option, it seems the numbers from the DoE site are likewise old, probably from early 2006 or there abouts. The 2006 consumption number on the DoE site was a forecast of average consumption. Not an estimate of consumption that had already happened(and their 2005 number was likely to be a very rough estimate at that point in time, hence it showing red in the spreadsheet). Which is where that difference in numbers with the CIA is coming into play. The percentiles that Sandia Natl labs was giving on the other hand weren&#39;t forecasts, they were estimates of consumption that has already happened.		</div>

						This just makes it seem like nobody actually has any real numbers on it and they&#39;re always estimating.  Since we&#39;re talking in terms of 1 or 2 years the data doesn&#39;t really constitute a trend anyway.  So I&#39;ll just say this.  When the US is consuming 25% of the worlds oil, and our usage drops, prices should drop.  Period.<br /><br />After 9-11 US consumption fell.  Prices rose.<br />around 2003-2004 consumption saw a brief rise, presumably because of the war blah blah.  Prices rose.<br />between 2005 and now consumption has fallen.  Prices have risen faster than ever before.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2008-04/21/content_6630888.htm" target="_blank">But its a moot point because OPEC themselves said that oil prices have little to do with supply and demand.

When the US is consuming 25% of the worlds oil, and our usage drops, prices should drop.  Period.</div><br /><br />Most economic data remains an &quot;estimate&quot; until 1 or 2 years after the fact when dealing with &quot;first world&quot; nations such as the United States. Generally speaking, the estimates that are out within ~6 months of the time period in question are very close to the &quot;final numbers&quot; that get put out there.<br /><br />I&#39;d lay odds on the DoE site I linked to having numbers for 2005 that aren&#39;t in red on the spreadsheet sometime in June or July, as they update that site to have numbers for 2007 on it. If that particular page is still being maintained(it may not be).<br /><br />Dealing with more &quot;third world&quot; nations gets more interesting when trying to do economic analysis on them. Record keeping may not be as good, and as such, may not be accurate at all. Which means more time is need to collate the various data points that do exist to try to come to a more solid number on where things stand there. So seeing them still classify India&#39;s consumption numbers for 2005 as an &quot;estimate&quot; isn&#39;t terribly surprising.<br /><br />And where have you seen indicators of US Demand dropping? The sources I&#39;ve found indicates US Demand for oil is continuing to increase, albeit at a greatly reduced rate... Unless you&#39;re discussing seasonal demand, which does run in cycles and is somewhat meaningless in the discussion of Oil prices. It will go down in some months, but it goes up in other months... And the trend(over the course of a year) will be a net increase.<br /><br />Now Gasoline Prices are another story, but that has a lot more to do with refinery capacity in the United States, and that fact that we have like 300 different &quot;blends&quot; of Gasoline...<br /><br />But going back to this:<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE (ANunes &#64; May 5 2008, 12&#58;14 PM) <a rel="nofollow" href="index.php?act=findpost&amp;pid=7952">&lt;{POST_SNAPBACK}&gt;</a></div><div class="quotemain">Since we&#39;re talking in terms of 1 or 2 years the data doesn&#39;t really constitute a trend anyway.

Period.</div><br /><br />2 years of data doesn&#39;t constitute a trend, and 6 years(2000 to 2006, which I have cited) evidently doesn&#39;t either?<br /><br />And then you&#39;re talking about how US consumption of Oil has been dropping? It certainly wasn&#39;t prior to 2005. Which means that you have less than 2 full years to work with on demonstrating a &quot;trend&quot; in that direction. (Using numbers for 2007 that aren&#39;t reliable just yet)<br /><br />Going back to this table:<br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/txt/ptb0501.html" target="_blank">http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/txt/ptb0501.html</a><br /><br />The only years in this decade that saw a decline in petrol use was:<br />2001 (52,000 fewer barrels per day versus 2000)<br />2006(estimate) with 214,000 fewer barrels per day versus 2005<br /><br />...compared to:<br />China&#39;s (forecast as of August 2006) increase in consumption during 2006 of 456,000 barrels per day versus 2005.<br /><br />So yay, the US used almost a quarter million fewer barrels of oil per day in 2006, while China started using almost half-a-million more barrels of oil per day. I think I can why lower demand in the US failed to result in a drop in the price of oil...		</div>

						I&#39;ve got no problems with capitalism.  But capitalism doesn&#39;t necessitate a stock market.<br /><br />Go ahead and invest in companies.  Don&#39;t speculate on commodities please.  Without some sort of forum for monetary exchanges (like the market) a ton of companies wouldn&#39;t ever have been able to get off the ground.  I just don&#39;t think that forum needs to be as much of an international clusterfuck as what we&#39;re doing now.<br /><br />Right now, when people hear that the price of oil has been going up steadily and is projected to basically double in price they are going to do the only thing that makes sense in a free market.  Help drive it up there faster.  Jump on board and get off just before the bubble pops.<br /><br />It would be less annoying if everyone could participate in the market in a meaningful way.  But when less than 1% of the people have more than 99% of the money... I&#39;m less optimistic.		</div>

						I heard that Nigeria just bought a 100-year lease to explore for oil in some part of the Gulf of Mexico while the US is not willing to do so.  Don&#39;t the stupid environmentalists who prevent us from doing so realize that we would get the oil out in a more environmentally friendly way than fking Nigeria would??&#33;@?@&#33;?@&#33;?		</div>

						Well Nigeria will probably just lease it to a U.S. or Euro Country. Then they will exploit the finds while adhering to the STRICT drilling/recovery standards of Nigeria. <br /><br />Just a bit of sarcasm there. &quot;BIG OIL&quot; most likely gave Nigeria the money to lease it. For the above mentioned reason. <br /><br />Sometimes I am a pessimist. (&gt; 99.8% )<br /><br />(sometimes I also post with a buzz, like now)		</div>

If only there were some economic jargon that described this phenomenon...<br /><br />I find if funny how financial news sources treat record oil prices as a good thing.

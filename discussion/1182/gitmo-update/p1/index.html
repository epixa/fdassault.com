						I&#39;ve only ever heard that come from Michelle Malkin.

						I would say that Gitmo keeps us safe.  However, I totally disagree with who we have put in there.  We should have only put people taken off the battlefield who were shooting at us into Gitmo.  Putting Bin Ladins taxi driver in there and those extremists from China makes absolutely no sense.<br /><br />In terms of the Japanese internment camps, I think its important to judge them in the context of the time.  Obviously it is easy for anybody today to see them as morally reprehensible, but if blacks were still second class citizens back then, then we had a huge problem with being racist and thought what we did to the Japanese made perfect sense.  I&#39;m sure there is an example of how the internment camps kept us safe, but it is exactly the same as Gitmo, we should discriminate highly who to put into such places so that we arent being unfair.  So maybe I could agree with the internment camps if they had limited who they put in them- say any Japanese person who had come to the US within the last 10 years who had been in the Japanese army and had no family in the States yet.		</div>

						And times of war are different Gov.  When the enemy was at the gate of the Roman Republic, the Senate would pick a consul to have unlimited power to make use of to stop the threat.  It was considered a civic duty for that person to save the city and then return it to the Senate.  They did not want to keep their power (until Caesar that is).  So if we used a power during war time that is not normally okay and did it to save our country, then it might be okay.  The power must be limited so that we do our best to do our civic duty properly and we must be willing to let go of that power when the threat ends.  Japanese internment camps were close to being okay.. they just needed to be limited to serve a better purpose.		</div>

						It is a big fucking difference.  The ideal was that people took the power because they had to, not because they wanted to.  Cincinatus(Spelled WRONG) was the ideal.  Someone taking it forcefully or through coersion is the exact opposite of what it was supposed to be.  So you saying that it&#39;s &quot;not a big fucken difference&quot; in this case is a big fucking difference, because it shows how you view things.  Taking something forcefully isn&#39;t a big difference for you, in relation to receiving something temporarily.  <br /><br />You&#39;d make an amazing tyrant.<br /><br />		</div>

						And which situation is most similar to the one we&#39;re in today.<br /><br />Cincinnatus (Spelled WRIGHT&#33;) : Aequeans hold a Roman City hostage, the senate panics and asks probably the least from among them to beat some ass.  He promptly does, hangs around for a while receiving accolades (about 18 years or so) and then retires... as an old man.  So really he just got bored and gave it back.  This WAS a dictatorship.<br /><br />Caesar: Came back from Gaul with his big ass army.  Pompei said that&#39;s effed up.  You can&#39;t come in here with your big ass army&#33;  And Caesar said, how bout a little one?  And crossed straight into the hood.  Then he fucked up Pompei&#39;s lieutenants, and was pronounced dictator in Rome, and Mark Anthony his official boy toy.  He held the dictatorship for 11 days.  He was re elected as a consul and chilled there for a minute and got merked by his boys for being too freakin&#39; popular.<br /><br />I&#39;ve had this parallel suggested to me in the past, and I&#39;ve never been able to see a really good one in either case...<br /><br />Today: America is attacked by Al-Qaeda, and we go hunting for Bin-Laden in Afghanistan.  Then Bush said that Iraq had WMD&#39;s.  Definitely.  Then he committed troops without making a formal declaration of war, bypassing the most fundamental purpose our legislative body can perform in one decision.  Then there were no WMD&#39;s so we had to make nice and fix what we broke.		</div>

						<a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnatus" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnatus</a><br />The article says Cincinnatus became dictator in 457 BC and he promptly beat the Aequians and resigned from his post within 16 days of getting it, returning to his farm.  In 439 BC he was made dictator again to put down a revolt and again resigned.  <br /><br />And no this is not a parallel for today.  We are not in dire straights.  At the instant we got hit by Japan for WWII, though, some people thought we were in dire straights and completely unprepared for a naval/aerial war.  So maybe at that time, suspending peoples&#39; liberties to keep up security might have been okay.  I know you don&#39;t think so, but that is all I was thinking about.		</div>

U.S. authorities handed over the detainee to the Afghan government, which in turn released him, according to Pentagon and CIA officials.<br /><br />Abdullah Ghulam Rasoul, formerly Guantanamo prisoner No. 008, was among 13 Afghan prisoners released to the Afghan government in December 2007. Rasoul is now known as Mullah Abdullah Zakir, a nom de guerre that Pentagon and intelligence officials say is used by a Taliban leader who is in charge of operations against U.S. and Afghan forces in southern Afghanistan.<br /><br />The officials, who spoke anonymously because they are not authorized to release the information, said Rasoul has joined a growing faction of former Guantanamo prisoners who have rejoined militant groups and taken action against U.S. interests. Pentagon officials have said that <b>as many as 60 former detainees have resurfaced on foreign battlefields.</b><br /><br />Pentagon and intelligence officials said <b>Rasoul has emerged as a key militant figure in southern Afghanistan</b>, where violence has been spiking in the last year. Thousands of U.S. troops are preparing to deploy there to fight resurgent Taliban forces.</div><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/us/10gitmo.html?_r=3&amp;hp" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/us/10git...tml?_r=3&amp;hp</a><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain"><b>The five detainees at Guantánamo Bay charged with planning the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks have filed a document with the military commission at the United States naval base there expressing pride at their accomplishment and accepting full responsibility for the killing of nearly 3,000 people.</b><br /><br />The document, which may be released publicly on Tuesday, uses the Arabic term for a consultative assembly in describing the five men as the “9/11 Shura Council,” and it says their actions were an offering to God, according to excerpts of the document that were read to a reporter by a government official who was not authorized to discuss it publicly.<br /><br />The document is titled “The Islamic Response to the Government’s Nine Accusations,” the military judge at the Guantánamo Bay detention camp said in a separate filing, obtained by The New York Times, that describes the detainees’ document.<br /><br />The document was filed on behalf of the five men, including Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who has described himself as the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks.<br /><br /><b>President Obama halted the military proceedings at Guantánamo in the first days after his inauguration, and the five men’s case is on hiatus until the government decides how it will proceed.</b></div>		</div>

This WAS a dictatorship.<br /><br />Caesar: Came back from Gaul with his big ass army.  Pompei said that&#39;s effed up.  You can&#39;t come in here with your big ass army&#33;  And Caesar said, how bout a little one?  And crossed straight into the hood.  Then he fucked up Pompei&#39;s lieutenants, and was pronounced dictator in Rome, and Mark Anthony his official boy toy.  He held the dictatorship for 11 days.  He was re elected as a consul and chilled there for a minute and got merked by his boys for being too freakin&#39; popular.<br /><br />I&#39;ve had this parallel suggested to me in the past, and I&#39;ve never been able to see a really good one in either case...<br /><br />Today: America is attacked by Al-Qaeda, and we go hunting for Bin-Laden in Afghanistan.  Then Bush said that Iraq had WMD&#39;s.  Definitely.  Then he committed troops without making a formal declaration of war, bypassing the most fundamental purpose our legislative body can perform in one decision.  Then there were no WMD&#39;s so we had to make nice and fix what we broke.</div><br /><br />You&#39;re a nice wordy person<br /><br />The fact that you spelled &quot;write&quot; as &quot;wright&quot; in relation to him using &quot;right&quot; - does that type of humor have a term for it?

Ok.<br /><br />I won&#39;t go so far as to call you stupid, cause I know you&#39;re not.  I will however call this out as a stark and dangerous misinterpretation of justice.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enemy_(military)" target="_blank">This is why I would say using the term &quot;enemy combatant&quot; is dangerous.</a>  Specifically that when WE say that word it means Al Qaeda and the taliban, while everyone else uses the strict definition.  What this means is that while enemy combatant is supposed to define people found on the field who can be dealt with through the normal legal channels, we use it to define anybody who we don&#39;t know what to do with, then we do with them as we please.  Please recognize that this would be completely unacceptable if the situation were reversed.<br /><br />You also assume that the 60 GB detainees who are currently involved with our enemies were previously involved with the enemy, an assumption which led to their detainment in the first place, and an assumption that was found to be baseless enough to lead to their release.  This kind of assumption is also, unequivocally, dangerous.		</div>

Thanks for being more engaging than pat dollard.</div><br /><br />Eh, I&#39;m not so sure that the majority of the people who were responsible for drafting the initial versions of the Geneva Conventions would necessarily disagree with how the US has handled it.<br /><br />The problem with a number of these &quot;enemy (illegal) combatants&quot; is that they were in large part, violation of(or otherwise operating outside of) those same Geneva Conventions. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Best case</span> they&#39;re war criminals and should be tried for war crimes.<br /><br />More typical case is that they fall under what would (then) have been broadly defined as spies &amp; assassins, and would be entitled to the appropriate treatment thereof.... Which is that they get no special protections under the Geneva Conventions of war.<br /><br />It&#39;s the general expectation that is what will happen to our own special forces when they&#39;re doing (deep) black ops. If they get caught, even though they were carrying out a military operation... Since they were (very likely) out of uniform and presumably attempting to carry out their (hostile) mission while blending in with the population(not to be confused with military personal in escape/evasion/general GTFO mode; its OK to not be in uniform when you&#39;re trying to get away/escape back to your own side... It isn&#39;t ok to be doing that when you&#39;re getting ready to/are in the process of #@&#36;%ing things up), they&#39;re not supposed to get any legal protection to speak of.<br /><br />Of course, the &quot;other side&quot; of this particular problem is that the initial rounds of the Geneva Conventions were written when there still was a general parity in the capabilities of both sides to fight/wage war. That no longer is the case where the United States in particular is concerned. So some of the concepts of warfare that it codifies would be absolutely insane for anyone on the other side(vs the US) to try to abide by, at least if they want their capabilities to stand a chance of surviving long enough to do damage to a &quot;main body&quot; of US forces.		</div>

						I understand that in a legal sense, the people we&#39;re rounding up and throwing in GB are very difficult to deal with.  I&#39;m not entirely sure what the right thing to do with them is, like most people.  What I do believe, is that it was the 100% wrong thing to call them by a name which is so poorly defined as to have no legal meaning whatsoever so that we could throw people into a prison which we specifically made sure wasn&#39;t in America so we could torture them with impunity.  Not that we are, but we could have been, and we did ... at least a little.<br /><br />I&#39;m fine with the war crimes thing.  At least then they get a trial, and hopefully people who were gathering explosives to strap to their nephews chest would be found guilty, and people who were driving their grandma to the mosque on the wrong day might be found innocent.<br /><br />I like how if you want to kill somebody and get away with it you just have to toss on a uniform so the other side can do it back.<br /><br />Humanity is a silly thing.		</div>

To be fair, it&#39;s just the reports outlining the plans surrounding the closure of the base, but still...  if that falls behind, the closing falls behind.  And that&#39;s balls.		</div>

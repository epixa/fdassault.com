						Well, bottom line is that she is an idiot. I laughed once I saw her GPA, she didn&#39;t work hard enough in college than complains that employers won&#39;t hire her. Plus when did any university or college give a guarantee for getting a job in your major after you graduate? To me she is just a lazy ass looking for some easy money in these rough times. She is the type of person who doesn&#39;t even deserve to live in our country.		</div>

						Honestly do any ridiculous sue cases surprise you guys anymore?<br /><br />Does she actually have any chance of winning this? When I hear about these ridiculous law suits State side I like to assume that the idiot in question will not get anything for their stupidity. Infact I often hope they will be in more debt due to the cost associted with their claim. <br /><br />Can one of you actually verify it that is the case, or is idiocy going to win out over common sense and logic and this bitch is going to get some money.<br /><br />It sucks for her she can&#39;t get a job, but welcome to the fucking economic crisis.		</div>

						Does anyone know exactly what the college promises in terms of finding employment?  I mean, some colleges basically guarantee that they will find you a job, and if that is the case here, then I don&#39;t think it is so easy to say that she&#39;s an idiot.  The fact is, no institution should be making guarantees that they don&#39;t plan to keep.<br /><br />If I&#39;m not mistaken, she&#39;s not suing the college because she&#39;s unemployed.  Instead she&#39;s suing the college because they didn&#39;t help her find a job to the same extent that they promised, and I think that is entirely reasonable to at least take the school to court to settle the matter.  My college in particular promised that their career services office would work tirelessly to help me find employment, and while I didn&#39;t end up utilizing them in my job search, I would have been furious if I did need their help and they didn&#39;t at least work as hard as they said they would.		</div>

						<div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">She suggested that Monroe&#39;s Office of Career Advancement shows preferential treatment to students with excellent grades. &quot;They favor more toward students that got a 4.0. They help them more out with the job placement,</div><br /><br />No shit?<br /><br />Of course they are going to favour students with better grades. That&#39;s called life. Had she worked harder she could have improved her grades and not be in the position she is in now.<br /><br />Should they be treating everyone equally? Sure. Are they going to? Of course not. It&#39;s easier for them to find placements for those better qualified. That&#39;s the way the world works. <br /><br />She is complaining about something thousands if not millions of other people will be going through. Furthermore, rather then take some responsibility she is blaming someone else for all her trouble.<br /><br />In my mind thats something idiots do. At some point down the line if she can&#39;t find the work, she is doing something wrong. Be is looking in the wrong places, in the wrong way or even at the wrong time, but she has to accept some sort of responsibility. As I mentioned before, she could have better grades had she worked harder and find herself in a more benificial position right now.<br /><br />While the credit crunch is a factor out of her control I get the feeling there are plenty of things she could have done in the past to not be in the position she is in now and there are certainly more things she could be doing in the future.		</div>

And plenty have a career center.  Now I&#39;ve never been in a career center in my life, mind you, but I have been in a writing center, and every writing center employee would tell me wildly different things that the center handled/helped with.  From JUST editing, down to help doing the freakin&#39; research.  I would not be surprised if every writing center had completely different mission statements.  Nothing that says, &quot;we guarantee an A+&quot;, but possibly as clear as &quot;We guarantee that every student will have access to a writing tutor from the hours of x to y, and that these tutors will provide guidance in the realms of a, b and c.<br /><br />It&#39;s not unreasonable for me to imagine a career center guaranteeing the service of providing employment leads, connections, referrals, resume consultation, interviewing consultation, etc.<br /><br />This young lady, however, needs to man up and make friends at a company she wants to work at.  Did she not apply to colleges herself?  Just let her high school counselor do that for her?		</div>

Once that&#39;s called into question, one has to wonder whether she&#39;s even pissed at the school, or whether she&#39;s just pissed at being poor and thinks she&#39;s clever enough to get a big payday while making the news.<br /><br /><br />		</div>

I think the market is the reason she can&#39;t get a job.<br /><br />I graduated with a 2.7 gpa and had an awesome job lined up before I graduated.

						But the thing is, it isn&#39;t even in her best interest to disclose all of the details of her case, so it is unlikely that what you read in these short articles is as thorough as necessary to formulate a decision on this.  Since the whole point of our judiciary system is to find out the truth about something and hold people accountable for their actions in an objective, clear-headed manner, I surely hope the judge that must decide whether to hear the case does so with far less uninformed poor judgment than what you guys have exhibited in this thread.<br /><br />I&#39;m not saying you can&#39;t weigh in on the issue, but there is a difference between discussing the merits of such an inquiry and arbitrarily assigning sweeping personal judgments on a person like this based only on the extremely limited knowledge you gleamed off a few media outlets.		</div>

						I should also clarify.  There are valuable college degrees out there.  But the attitude we have in this world right now of getting degrees because it&#39;s the next thing to do after high school is due for a shake-up.  This girl spent 70k based on an assumption that when she graduated she&#39;d be able to get a management position at a fortune 500 company.  Unfortunately, so did the other 500 graduates of her schools program (an out-of-my-ass number) and so did the other graduates from the other 3000 schools in this country.<br /><br />She didn&#39;t get a job because she picked a freaking BBA... that&#39;s fit for managing *MAYBE* a Starbucks.  It&#39;s not even an MBA, which are a dime a dozen...  Everybody wants to be the boss these days.  It&#39;s crappy.  And I have a tinge of disdain for the sort of person that falls for it.<br /><br />/you&#39;re better off with a freakin&#39; bartending degree right now.  Go to it, indebted girl.  If you&#39;re cute you&#39;ll make good tips.  If not, you better make good drinks.		</div>

In particular when the layman is predisposed to thinking the plaintiff is a dickwad.<br /><br />Here are two potential scenarios that fit the facts we have at our disposal.<br /><br />1. The college helped her draft her resume, and gave her access to a database of prospective employers who would be interested in her skill set.<br />2. The college gives her a list of some good mechanics she can be the secretary of.  With no phone numbers attached.  And the list has a shit stain on it.<br /><br />I&#39;d be annoyed with number 2 myself.  But she&#39;s approaching this from the wrong angle.  She should totally make it a gender discrimination case.<br /><br />		</div>

The fact that most students don&#39;t care enough to utilize them is a shame.  It is actually a competitive edge for a school to have one (&quot;Our graduates make an average of &#36;x a year within y years of graduation&quot;).<br /><br />Again, if the school made a promise and doesn&#39;t deliver, they are responsible.  That&#39;s it.<br /><br />I agree that it sounds like an angry, unemployed, misled person, but I haven&#39;t seen any facts to back up one way or the other.  Until the court case closes, I can&#39;t make an accurate judgment.		</div>

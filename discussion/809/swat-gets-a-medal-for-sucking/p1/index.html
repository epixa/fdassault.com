They investigated the info got some warrants and proceeded to raid three houses.  Upon busting down one of the doors they encountered a husband and father of 6.  Responding to the intruders he whips out a shot gun and blasts them in the body armor.  WHen this fails they open fire and rain hell on him.  Fortunately these well trained officers of the law SUCK at shooting so they didn&#39;t hit him.  At all.<br /><br />They are being given medals for acting professionally.<br /><br />USAUSAUSAUSAUSA&#33;		</div>

						I saw this on Reddit.   There was one really good comment about why the SWAT members did deserve the medal.  <br /><br />The mistake wasn&#39;t theirs.  They didn&#39;t chose which house to bust into.  It was a mistake higher up in the ladder.  The Members of the SWAT team handled the situation with care.  No member of the household was hurt, and since the officers were being fired upon, they would have had the right to use deadly force.  The SWAT team kept their heads cool and didn&#39;t kill anyone before they figured out what was going on.<br /><br />If I were a member of the team, I would have refused the medal on principal.

						I strongly disagree with you on this one, Andrew.  I don&#39;t really understand what frustrates you about this, actually.  The cops break down the door and a man shoots them with a shotgun.  They respond by opening fire.  Luckily for both parties, no one was seriously injured.  Why exactly does the shitty detective work preceding this event devalue the extreme danger the officers (and the man, for that matter) were put in?<br /><br />Who cares if they get paid to do that?  All U.S. soldiers get paid to do the job they do; does that mean it should disqualify them from receiving military recognition for their courage and service?<br /><br />It&#39;s not like body armor makes the cops invincible.  A well placed shotgun blast could have killed any one of them.<br /><br />I&#39;m not saying the whole situation couldn&#39;t have been avoided, but it wasn&#39;t.  And I&#39;d be willing to be the brave men that went into that house didn&#39;t really have a say in which house they entered.		</div>

						It pisses me off because there is a right way to conduct these raids that has been warped because of the war on drugs.<br /><br />1) Wait for people in the house to leave, arrest them.<br />2) Get on a loudspeaker and call out for the remaining people to evacuate<br />3) Only after anybody who is going to leave actually leaves, go in and prepare to come under fire<br />4) Fire only when fired at<br />5) FUCKING HIT THEM OH MY FUCKING GOD HOW ARE THEY THIS BAD AT THEIR JOBS<br />6) Don&#39;t collect a medal for doing the job you signed up for<br /><br />What they did was skip steps 1 through 3  and neglected 5 and 6.<br /><br />The reason we don&#39;t do those first three any more is because it gives gangsters an opportunity to flush drugs and arm themselves.  But since they show that getting shot with a shotgun won&#39;t hurt them I don&#39;t think I&#39;m too worried about the arming.  They have flashbangs.  They have smoke grenades.  They chose the absolute WORST approach to raiding this house in an attempt to get a drug bust too and they are lucky nobody died.		</div>

						Coffee, you wouldn&#39;t do that.  I&#39;m sorry.  No person in the right mind who was carrying a gun at the time and who got SHOT at would find a hiding place and try to talk down the assailant as they unloaded their 12 gauge.  Police carry guns to protect themselves.  They have pretty strict rules for the use of those guns, and I whole-heartedly support such regulations.  Many times, the use of a gun is really hard to determine whether it would be justified or not.  Do you shoot someone who is threatening to kill another person?  Do you shoot someone who is threatening to kill themselves?  Do you shoot someone who is unintentionally putting others in danger?  These are all really tough questions that demand heavy scrutiny.  However, there is one clear and unquestionably correct time for a police officer to use their gun: when they are shot at.<br /><br />There isn&#39;t time for running through your firearm regulations book, and this isn&#39;t the fucking movies.  You don&#39;t get the opportunity when someone is firing a shotgun at you to dive behind the magically bulletproof lazy-boy.  Your best chance for survival (and your friends&#39; best chance for survival) is to pull the trigger.  That&#39;s what it is for; when would it be more appropriate for the use of deadly force than when someone is trying to kill you?<br /><br />And he shot the cops.  They were lucky that he happened to hit their chest which happened to be the most heavily armored part of their entire body.  Once again (and I&#39;m really not trying to blame the guy here), the guy didn&#39;t have time to think about where he could conveniently place his shots on the off-chance that the intruder might run away instead of simply shooting him and his family dead.  He shot to kill because it was the only reasonable defense against a group of armed intruders.  He shot to kill because he&#39;s not a dumbass who thinks he&#39;d have enough time to evaluate the situation before making a decision about his next course of action.<br /><br />Andrew, you have no idea what the situation was.  I agree with you on your first point to an extent, but there are plenty of reasons why that wouldn&#39;t work.  Fuck, even the god damn animal cops have trouble apprehending suspects in that way, and they&#39;re just there to collect a fine.<br /><br />This isn&#39;t just about the war on drugs.  In some situations, the megaphone works.  In this particular situation, it would have ended the entire situation without a shot fired.  But had the intel been correct, who knows who was inside that house.  Maybe the use of a megaphone could have turned into a hostage situation.  Maybe the guy they were actually after was such a danger that they knew he&#39;d simply open fire out of the windows putting the lives of all of the neighbors and other police personal outside.  Maybe surprise, as it has been on other occasions, was considered the safest plan for the people inside the house, the swat team, the police, and the bystanders throughout the neighborhood.  Surprise raids work.  They often go down without any shots fired.  I&#39;m all about the alternative you mentioned, but I&#39;m also not naive enough to assume that course of action is right in all situations.<br /><br />As for the missing part, you once again are unaware of the situation.  It is extremely difficult to fire a well aimed shot when you are quickly spinning around.  I&#39;m sure it is 100x more difficult when it is dark, you&#39;re in an unknown surrounding, you are caught by surprise, and you&#39;re taking fire.  To top it all off, this isn&#39;t the movies.  I doubt the dude came running out of his bedroom guns ablazing.  He could have turned a hallway corner or just out of a doorway expecting to see one or two guys, saw a ton of geared up dudes with sub machine guns, and simply fired a shot as he pulled back into the room he came from.  Because they&#39;re not batshit nuts, the team would then return some fire, if for no other reason, as a reaction to taking fire.  I have no idea what the situation was, but I certainly think that sounds pretty plausible.<br /><br />And your last point about the &quot;job you signed up for&quot; is absolutely bogus.  Who the fuck cares what they signed up to do?  That doesn&#39;t devalue the work at all.  They weren&#39;t rewarded civilian medals, they were rewarded police medals for their work in a life-threatening situation.  Fuck, the bouncing bombers that flew all-but-guaranteed suicide missions in WWII volunteered to do it; does that mean they don&#39;t deserve the distinguished honors they received?<br /><br />And finally, they are lucky no one died.

In my opinion, you usually seem to hit the nail on the head when it comes to controversial or political issues, but I sincerely think you are <i>way</i> off-base here.

						That paints a different picture.  But color me skeptical.<br /><br />I&#39;ll say that if that&#39;s the real story than hell yes give these guys a medal.  Otherwise they actually did a pretty mediocre job.  That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying.  They are all brave men, who put themselves in harms way every time they are on the job in an earnest and sincere attempt to keep people like you and me safe.  Most of the time they do a damned good job.  But when they don&#39;t do a good job they shouldn&#39;t get medals.<br /><br />Listen, I distrust cops for a number of reasons.  When you get repeatedly harassed carrying your skateboard through a town borough on your way home, but can&#39;t get them to come to your house when there&#39;s an intruder, you start to lose faith in them.  So yes, I&#39;m biased against the authorities.  I don&#39;t believe they function to protect or serve any longer.  I don&#39;t believe they think they are in the employment of the citizens.  They don&#39;t have to answer to mistakes they make.  They don&#39;t have to answer to abuses of power.  I&#39;m hyper critical of law enforcement.<br /><br />For what it&#39;s worth I respect each and every officer I&#39;ve never met.  I respect most of the ones I have.  I don&#39;t know what I would do in the situation, and they had a very difficult choice to make.  I&#39;m not even entirely sure what actually happened.  I&#39;ve been arguing against giving them a medal because typical step 2 is to deny the family any money to repair their bullet riddled house and use the fact that these guys are decorated as leverage.  They don&#39;t seem to be doing that here and I think that&#39;s awesome.  <br /><br />/I wasn&#39;t privy to all the new shit.<br /><br />(Their body armor is apparently good enough to keep them alive after getting shot in the face and neck with a shotgun...?)<br /><br />PS:  I&#39;m having a shitty week and am feeling pretty much all around curmudgeonly and adversarial.  Probably could&#39;ve toned down the rhetoric a bit.  I don&#39;t know what they got the medal for, if it&#39;s just a &quot;here&#39;s the medal you get when you get shot at&quot;   then my outrage is completely unwarranted.		</div>

						The only real problem on the SWAT side of this story is the guy with the shotgun didn&#39;t die. Not saying that i want to see him die but he did fire upon police officers who are trained to fire back. There are many different things that could have happened in the house that prevented the SWAT team from hitting him. The owner for the house obviously knows his house better so he probably has a better idea of where to hide for the best advantage. <br /><br />If anything I&#39;d say be mad and go on your rant about the Task force that handled the investigation. They got the bad intel, they sent them to the wrong house. <br /><br />The SWAT guys were doing what they are trained to do, take orders from investigators or task forces and execute warrants and other high risk operations.<br /><br />What is it you do for work, Andrew? Just out of curiosity.		</div>

						I&#39;m in IT.  I am a code and support monkey.  We just got a goofy new pair of printers that I&#39;ve been trying to get up and running for about 2 weeks now and it&#39;s been a new problem every day.  Hence my short fuse.<br /><br />To accurately convey my point:<br />If this is the way we deal with all high risk warrants, innocent people WILL die.  I think that when you&#39;re an agency whose job is to make the streets safer, then you have a duty to limit the risk that you are a menace to innocents as much as possible.  I don&#39;t think this system is sufficient.  You folks are right, I don&#39;t know the details of what happened, I wasn&#39;t there.  So I shouldn&#39;t speak about their receipt of the medal.  However there is something fundamentally wrong with this approach.<br /><br />Having recently read <a rel="nofollow" href="http://blogs.salon.com/0002762/stories/2003/08/17/drugWarVictims.html" target="_blank">this </a>also made this story boil my blood.  There ARE a bunch of shitty, shoot first ask questions later, sweep under the rug SWAT officers.  These people are lucky to not have been another set to make an appearance on that page.		</div>

I&#39;m sorry.  No person in the right mind who was carrying a gun at the time and who got SHOT at would find a hiding place and try to talk down the assailant as they unloaded their 12 gauge.  Police carry guns to protect themselves.  They have pretty strict rules for the use of those guns, and I whole-heartedly support such regulations.  Many times, the use of a gun is really hard to determine whether it would be justified or not.  Do you shoot someone who is threatening to kill another person?  Do you shoot someone who is threatening to kill themselves?  Do you shoot someone who is unintentionally putting others in danger?  These are all really tough questions that demand heavy scrutiny.  However, there is one clear and unquestionably correct time for a police officer to use their gun: when they are shot at.<br /><br />There isn&#39;t time for running through your firearm regulations book, and this isn&#39;t the fucking movies.  You don&#39;t get the opportunity when someone is firing a shotgun at you to dive behind the magically bulletproof lazy-boy.  Your best chance for survival (and your friends&#39; best chance for survival) is to pull the trigger.  That&#39;s what it is for; when would it be more appropriate for the use of deadly force than when someone is trying to kill you?<br /><br />And he shot the cops.  They were lucky that he happened to hit their chest which happened to be the most heavily armored part of their entire body.  Once again (and I&#39;m really not trying to blame the guy here), the guy didn&#39;t have time to think about where he could conveniently place his shots on the off-chance that the intruder might run away instead of simply shooting him and his family dead.  He shot to kill because it was the only reasonable defense against a group of armed intruders.  He shot to kill because he&#39;s not a dumbass who thinks he&#39;d have enough time to evaluate the situation before making a decision about his next course of action.<br /><br />Andrew, you have no idea what the situation was.  I agree with you on your first point to an extent, but there are plenty of reasons why that wouldn&#39;t work.  Fuck, even the god damn animal cops have trouble apprehending suspects in that way, and they&#39;re just there to collect a fine.<br /><br />This isn&#39;t just about the war on drugs.  In some situations, the megaphone works.  In this particular situation, it would have ended the entire situation without a shot fired.  But had the intel been correct, who knows who was inside that house.  Maybe the use of a megaphone could have turned into a hostage situation.  Maybe the guy they were actually after was such a danger that they knew he&#39;d simply open fire out of the windows putting the lives of all of the neighbors and other police personal outside.  Maybe surprise, as it has been on other occasions, was considered the safest plan for the people inside the house, the swat team, the police, and the bystanders throughout the neighborhood.  Surprise raids work.  They often go down without any shots fired.  I&#39;m all about the alternative you mentioned, but I&#39;m also not naive enough to assume that course of action is right in all situations.<br /><br />As for the missing part, you once again are unaware of the situation.  It is extremely difficult to fire a well aimed shot when you are quickly spinning around.  I&#39;m sure it is 100x more difficult when it is dark, you&#39;re in an unknown surrounding, you are caught by surprise, and you&#39;re taking fire.  To top it all off, this isn&#39;t the movies.  I doubt the dude came running out of his bedroom guns ablazing.  He could have turned a hallway corner or just out of a doorway expecting to see one or two guys, saw a ton of geared up dudes with sub machine guns, and simply fired a shot as he pulled back into the room he came from.  Because they&#39;re not batshit nuts, the team would then return some fire, if for no other reason, as a reaction to taking fire.  I have no idea what the situation was, but I certainly think that sounds pretty plausible.<br /><br />And your last point about the &quot;job you signed up for&quot; is absolutely bogus.  Who the fuck cares what they signed up to do?  That doesn&#39;t devalue the work at all.  They weren&#39;t rewarded civilian medals, they were rewarded police medals for their work in a life-threatening situation.  Fuck, the bouncing bombers that flew all-but-guaranteed suicide missions in WWII volunteered to do it; does that mean they don&#39;t deserve the distinguished honors they received?<br /><br />And finally, they are lucky no one died.  That would have been awful.  Of course, it is fortunate that the guy survived.  But it is equally fortunate that <i>they</i> survived.  Body armor doesn&#39;t make them invincible.<br /><br />I&#39;m incredibly disappointed with your reckless abandon when approaching this scenario with a clear bias against the authorities.  In my opinion, you usually seem to hit the nail on the head when it comes to controversial or political issues, but I sincerely think you are <i>way</i> off-base here.  All of your points are relying on board assumptions at best or wild speculation at worst.</div><br /><br /><br />I agree with you to some extent.  That being said, claiming that Andrew shouldn&#39;t use hypotheticals when talking about in house gunplay, and then using hypotheticals to back your own arguments is weak.  Also, being familiar with firearms does not a tactical firefight expert make.  <br /><br />Also, whether the right coarse of action was kicking down the door or using a megaphone is entirely unimportant to this argument BECAUSE of a lack of details as to who&#39;s house they were supposed to be visiting, and without that detail we have no idea.  Do I think they deserved a medal?  I really don&#39;t know.  The letter from the police chief says that they were literally using their bodies to shield the kids in another room from getting lit up with buckshot.  If that&#39;s entirely true, than shit, I&#39;ll pin the fucking medals on them myself.  <br /><br />I think in the long run, andrew doesn&#39;t know the details any better than we do, now.  That puts us all on pretty even ground, so going after him because his opinion in this situation is different than yours is kind of...  self important, I guess.  Noone else knows what really happened any better than he does, so, we lack the perspective to say &quot;this is correct/stop overreacting...&quot; etc.<br /><br />Also important is that, regardless of the whole mess, it wasn&#39;t the swat officers who fucked up the house number.  It was the people above them.  So that&#39;s who made the whole fucked up situation possible.		</div>

						There is a key difference between Andrew&#39;s assumptions and my hypothetical examples:  Andrew used his assumptions to draw a sweeping conclusion about the scenario (one that happened to also be built upon his previous stereotypes of police officers); I, on the other hand, was using hypothetical situations to show that there could be different, completely plausible alternative scenarios to Andrew&#39;s that would appear to shed an entirely different light on the situation.<br /><br />I&#39;m not disappointed that Andrew thinks the cops don&#39;t deserve their medals.  My hypothetical situation was just suppose to show that they <i>could</i> deserve the medals.  No, I&#39;m disappointed that Andrew would develop such an extreme opinion about a situation that he knows he has a clear bias on and that he knows extremely little about what really went down.<br /><br />This wasn&#39;t a &quot;the cops unloaded their entire clips twice into an unarmed black father of four who actually died instantly from the impact of the first bullet&quot; scenario.  This was a &quot;bad intel led to a shitty situation where shots were fired and luckily no one was hurt&quot; scenario.  But since we don&#39;t have any good information about the extent of the intel, we have no idea what actually happened in the house, and we&#39;re completely unaware of how the swat team handled itself, it is simply unreasonable of us to draw any conclusion about the merits of anyone involved.		</div>

						I&#39;ll roll with that.  A lot of this lies on the ways investigators are allowed to get information.  <br /><br />On the flip side, the man with the shotgun&#39;s a goddamn superman.  If they HAD been robbers or what have you he&#39;d have three headless robbers on the floor.  Proof positive that people with guns and some basic training are better protected than people with police.<br /><br />&lt;rant.  run now, last chance&gt;<br />Ima take the fight back there actually because I feel like I misrepresented myself.  Raise your hand if you feel like police make you safer.  What are the police&#39;s primary duties?  The oath is to protect and serve yeah yeah whatever.  But what do police spend most of their time doing?  Enforcing laws, right?  What laws?  How much of their time do they spend doing what?<br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://ci.baton-rouge.la.us/dept/brpd/pdf/Police_Duties.pdf" target="_blank">Let&#39;s look up an example:</a> PDF sorry...<br /><br />o Patrols:  they drive around looking for crimes being committed.  Speeders will be ticketed.  And if they stumble on something cooler, then good for them.<br />o Meter Maiding... I feel safer already<br />o Responding to calls.  If you feel threatened by something, 9-1-1 isn&#39;t going to help you.  They wait until you get shot or stabbed then they send out investigators to bully the locals and an ambulance to pick you up.  They don&#39;t have time to take everything seriously.  This isn&#39;t their fault, it&#39;s a limitation on the system.<br />o Other non-violent crime calls - car accidents, fires, violations of parole, etc.  Paperwork.<br />o Living traffic light<br />o Prisoner escort<br />o Confiscation: my favorite.  I call it &quot;stealing&quot;.  Isn&#39;t that clever? (have had 2 skateboards stolen by police.  I wasn&#39;t riding them either time, and my complaints were answered with &quot;did you get the officer&#39;s name?&quot;  the first time, and the second time, when I HAD the name I got a big fat, &quot;You know better.  It says here you&#39;ve had a previous run in with us over the same infraction.&quot;)<br />o reloading ammo at the police academy<br /><br />So 2 of this posting&#39;s assignments actually help keep you safe (3 if you count escorting prisoners).  And they inherently do crappy jobs of it (except that 3rd one).  Most of the rest are basically oppressive.  Speeders don&#39;t scare me.  Parking violations?  give me a break.  It IS nice to  have a cop in an intersection if he/she knows what he/she is doing.  And seizure of property.<br /><br />About that prison escort thing.  I leave you with this:<br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/crimoff.htm" target="_blank">&quot;In 2000, an estimated 57% of Federal inmates and 21% of State inmates were serving a sentence for a drug offense; about 10% of Federal inmates and 49% of State inmates were in prison for a violent offense.&quot;</a><br /><br />So there&#39;s less than a 50% chance that the people they are escorting are violent criminals.  That&#39;s nice.<br />&lt;/rant&gt;		</div>

						Speeders don&#39;t scare you??? You do realize that if there were no speeding laws people would be driving around like crazy assholes. If there are laws, you need someone to enforce them.<br /><br />I think they do an excellent job protecting us.<br /><br />I mean i understand your argument, but you have to realize that they do  put their lives on the risk for us, and they definitely do NOT get paid enough for that shit. I was reading a article in the newspaper recently and they mentioned how new recruits in the NYPD get a starting pay of like 35G if i&#39;m right. Realy, that pay sucks in my opinion especially for what they do.<br /><br />Do not get me wrong, there are a lot of people that represent the police force wrong, just like any other job force<br />but they do deserve respect out of all things.		</div>

						Why do they call it &quot;medical marijuana&quot;? There is no such thing. Pot is pot. Just fucking call it marijuana... I just saw a thing on tv about a guy in some California city may face up to 100 years in jail for having a business where he gave out marijuana to people with horrible migraines and headaches. He business was legal and recognized by the city in which he lived/had his business out of, but the state of California didn&#39;t.		</div>

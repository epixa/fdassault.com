						Probably.  Has anyone heard or read about <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mayhill-fowler/obama-exclusive-audio-on_b_96333.html" target="_blank">Obama&#39;s comments</a> in California?  idk, I think people are blowing it way out of proportion, which is more or less par for the course so far.  <br /><br />Taken completely out of a context that I think makes it seem much less callous and elitist:<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">You go into some of these small towns in Pennsylvania, and like a lot of small towns in the Midwest, the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing&#39;s replaced them. And they fell through the Clinton Administration, and the Bush Administration, and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not. And it&#39;s not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren&#39;t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.</div><br /><br />How do you all take it?  Frankly, this campaign has turned away from issues and towards catching the candidates saying silly things on the record.  But this is probably because Clinton and Obama&#39;s policies are around 85-90% identical and all we have to differentiate them is their politics which resolves to how they present themselves to the public.  Which resolves to what kind of dumb shit they say during the campaign.  <br /><br />edit: seriously though... this is the big Obama issue right now.<br />They both say the same good things, so we pick up on the garbage.		</div>

						I have yet to meet a young person that is offended by this.  God damn old people again&#33;<br /><br />I think the whole thing is stupid.  They can&#39;t even pinpoint one particular part of the quote that is offensive.  Some say it is him calling us bitter (which I think it is more than safe to say that we are).  Some say it was him grouping religion into the same category as anti-trade and stuff.  Some say it is the simple fact that he is generalizing at all.<br /><br />Please.  I&#39;m not going to say it won&#39;t hurt him because clearly people are quite dumb (I don&#39;t mind generalizing), but the whole thing is ludicrous.		</div>

						&quot;And it&#39;s not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns ... as a way to explain their frustrations.&quot;<br /><br />Uh? I just like guns. I profoundly enjoy things that go bang, and I am offended that they believe there&#39;s something wrong with that. And besides that, the biggest threat to tyranny is an armed and informed populace. Gun ownership isn&#39;t my tool to express my frustration with the government so much as it is that I want to own a firearm. The manner of speech is such that it belittles the people who disagree; as if I and people like me are somehow wrong, insane, or inferior for wanting a free choice in the matter. I&#39;m not violent or disagreeable because I own a gun. I never killed anyone, or even aimed the thing at a person. I like shooting. I&#39;m not any stupider because of it.<br /><br />And this isn&#39;t so much about their specific statements as it is the attitude of a lot of people who support gun control. There&#39;s an unbased assumption here that owning a gun means the owner is violent and extreme, which is absolute nonsense. Anyway I think I said my peace.		</div>

						I heard that statement (as quoted) the day after he said it.  I thought about it.  I didn&#39;t feel angered or offended by it.<br /><br />The more I thought about, the more I could see what he saw.  He wasn&#39;t addressing everyone in Pennsylvania.  He was targeting a specific demographic.  Maybe it didn&#39;t get across the way it should have, and that may have been his fault for not choosing his words carefully enough.  In total honesty, it has been blown out of proportion.		</div>

						When he speaks about clinging to guns he&#39;s speaking about people&#39;s tendency to vote using gun rights as their primary issue after becoming disillusioned with Washington&#39;s ability and/or desire to help these people&#39;s economic situations.  <br /><br />There is no negative connotation in there at all.   He&#39;s 100% correct.  It&#39;s the same thing with abortion rights or how much faith (how &quot;christian&quot;) someone has.  There are issues that people have picked up because other issues seem like a losing battle and gun rights is one of them.		</div>

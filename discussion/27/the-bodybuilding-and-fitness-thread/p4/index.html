						to be honest, I think that ratio is somewhat absurd. If you are consuming 3000 calories a day, that means only 34g of fat per day. Which is the same as 4 tbls of peanut butter. That also means 450g of protein a day which is ridiculous. If you have 4 meals with 50g of protein each, you need to take in 250g of protein from shakes. I think the 40/30/30 is a much better ratio to follow by because it gives you a bit of leeway with your fats. <br /><br />My eating habits are a bit loose since I&#39;m still young, but I try to get about 1.25 times by bodyweight in protein and then fill the rest of my calories with healthy carbs and fats. Also, I think you should try to limit your protein shake intake to two a day. Protein shakes are supposed to be supplements and should be used sparingly.		</div>

						I agree with GNS for bulking, but cutting Mungo has it right.<br /><br />But, when I bulk, I don&#39;t care what the hell I eat, I just make sure I eat a hell of a lot of calories and make it mostly protein and carbs.		</div>

I&#39;m assuming he&#39;s within his first 6 months of lifting, and that losing body fat was a priority on his list that trumps bulking. I could be wrong, but that&#39;s what I imagined. <br /><br />NR: As long as you lift, and eat healthily, you&#39;ll do fine. If you are really determined to lose weight in a healthy way, you should follow my ratio as best as you can. If all you care about is gaining muscle mass all you have to do is eat. Eat healthfully, but eat a lot.		</div>

You take in more protein through shakes than through real food. That doesn&#39;t sound very healthy to me...<br />2. 150g of protein in shakes is about 5-6 scoops of protein depending on how many g&#39;s you have per scoop. That is a hell of a lot money to burn through. If you get 90 servings of whey for &#36;40.00, you are gonna go through that tub in 15 days... That equates to nearly &#36;1000 a year for just protein powder. A bit much in my opinion<br />3. You most definitely can have too much protein in your diet. Think about how we absorb and utilize calories. Absorbtion occurs within the small intestine. The small intestine doesn&#39;t choose what to digest or not, it just digests everything. An excess amount of protein is going to be absorbed and stored as fat, not passed through waste. If that were the case, we would be shitting ridiculous amounts of meat through our asses a day. All excess calories are stored as fat for later use.		</div>

						For the past few days what Ive been doing is eating 8x a day. 3 full meals, each with protein and carbs, and 5 snacks. The snacks have been nothing but fruits/veggies. Basically, Id eat every 2 hours. Id have two snacks before lunch, two before dinner, and 1 after dinner. I havent really been paying attention to how many grams of protein/carbs Ive been consuming until now. <br /><br />Would you guys recommend staying on this plan or do you have any modifications?		</div>

That is a hell of a lot money to burn through. If you get 90 servings of whey for &#36;40.00, you are gonna go through that tub in 15 days...

Think about how we absorb and utilize calories. Absorbtion occurs within the small intestine. <i>The small intestine doesn&#39;t choose what to digest or not, it just digests everything.

However, I&#39;ll agree that not everything we don&#39;t doesn&#39;t pass through our bodies unabsorbed. With that being said, fat is more easily absorbed then carbs, carbs the protein.</div>		</div>

						christ how can you even afford to eat so frequently. Even at my peak when i had time and minimal responsibilities, ie school, i&#39;d estimate that i was spending around &#36;20 per day not including shakes, even though i was cooking a lot of it myself. now because of work and shit i only eat 2-3 meals a day and barely work out. Shit&#39;s too expensive now a days. I was in hong kong last month and I was eating like every 2 minutes because food was so good and sooooo cheap. A full meal for 3 people, 3-4 bowls of rice plus plates and plates of veggies and meat and whatever cost &lt;&#36;20. Even in shanghai you can get a <i>massive</i> bowl of noodles for 5 RMB which is less than &#36;1. fuck.		</div>

Starting out you don&#39;t need to eat that much protein, but when you get to where I am at it is worth it. Plus, like I said b4 real food would cost more per g of protein.<br />3. This is correct. You could even go further and say it is bad for your liver, but the way I train and I am sure Mungo trains, we use most if not all that protein we eat. Especially the way Mungo eats, he probably uses some of that protein to burn as energy (when the carbs go, then you burn off the protein, then the stored body fat).		</div>

						The cost of the groceries wasnt too bad, actually.

Most people think the more you workout, the faster and better the results. But thats not the case at all. Your results come in your rest periods, and in your eating habbits. You don&#39;t want to be in the gym more than 45 mins - 1 hr and dont overload yourself with trying to do as many exercises as possible. <br /><br />Ive always loved 3 day splits, and recommend them to anyone. Each day contains 5 exercises (more/less depending on mood) mainly compounds and 1-2 isolation&#39;s. This allows me to keep a good amount of energy throughout the week, and still achieve results that I&#39;m happy with.		</div>

The isolations would be exercises that are only isolating the smaller muscle group (ie on chest/triceps day, your iso&#39;s would only be triceps..not chest. chest would be covered in compounds)<br /><br /><br />edit: I agree with true believer. i have a bodyspace there and its nice the way its formatted and such. the people are very friendly and informative.		</div>

						I find it to work fine for me. I usually do something along the lines of:<br /><br />Squat<br />Leg Curls<br />Calf Raises<br />Standing military Press<br />Shrugs<br /><br />Of course it&#39;s a matter of preference, I&#39;ve just found that the chest / tri&#39;s, back / bi&#39;s compliment each other very nicely, so the only combination left would be legs/shoulders if your sticking to a 3 day.		</div>

Zero QFT<br /><br />I lost most of my BF by doing 40 meter sprints and running miles and miles at practice. It&#39;s all about watching what you eat and fitness fitness fitness. Don&#39;t take a supplement to make you lose weight, it WILL hurt your body long before it could help. For sure stay away from that shit.<br /><br />edit: can to WILL		</div>

						My workout is Martial Arts,been studying since the age of 4.Never stopped and I won&#39;t,I love the competition of it. I am in good shape I am 6&#39;5&quot; and 250lbs.I do my cardio and stetics.If I lift I usually go at 3am just so nobody is their and I can get my workout in with no disturbance. I only go if I see fit that I need to do so,I usually just work chest/lowerback.Arms/Legs.If I go to the gym I work out for 3 hrs.I don&#39;t do quick workouts I push myself till I can&#39;t go no more.But that is what brings up my stamina in tourneys.		</div>

						I entered an Olympic lifting meet on Saturday for the heck of it.<br /><br />65-67-70 in the snatch<br />80-82(f)-82 in the clean and jerk<br /><br />It was a developmental meet, so I actually got a few extra attempts. I cleaned 85 and 87, but both jerks were pressed out. I was pretty beat from the snatch, which was a 10kg personal record. Good times, can&#39;t wait to enter another&#33;		</div>

Maybe it was the hair, the ugly mug, or the tattoos, or maybe I&#39;m thinking of the wrong person. So when you say, &#39;I only go if i see fit,&#39; and then only lift a few body parts for well over anyone&#39;s standard time constraints I doubt what you say. You don&#39;t lift shoulders or the majority of your back and you&#39;re in martial arts competitions? How have you not hurt yourself?<br /><br />Sorry, hate to be a skeptic, but this sounds too fishy for me to pass up.		</div>

All the time.<br /><br />We don&#39;t tax money for existing here, we tax it for moving.  Why shouldn&#39;t you be taxed on moving amounts of money that are equivalent to 0.03% of the country&#39;s GDP?  And how, precisely, do heirs &quot;earn&quot; any of that money.  It&#39;s a gift, of sorts, as far as I&#39;m concerned.  And if you gave me &#36;5,000,000.00 I can be quite certain that I&#39;m not actually seeing that much.<br /><br />The amount of the tax seems potentially punitive.  But I hate rich people and nepotism anyway, so in the interest of sticking it to them, and on the theory that I will never have to worry about it personally, I declare this a win for democracy.		</div>

Try taking 40% of your million and see how you feel about it then.</div><br /><br />People don&#39;t normally get too uppity about the taxes they receive on their lottery winnings.  Certainly not to a degree where fucking congress would work to change the policy to avoid upsetting the .3% of the population that owns 90% of ... well... everything.<br /><br />It&#39;s consistent.  Taxes on poor folks apparently don&#39;t exist, and taxes on rich folk are an undue burden which stifles economic growth.  I know the drill.<br /><br />The estate tax&#39;s purpose is to prevent an aristocracy from becoming overdeveloped in this country as that&#39;s just one step shy of the utter destruction of our democracy.  An established aristocracy would be worse for this country than communism.  As a stop on such a change, it likely needs to be adjusted every now and again, much like the AMT.  So I&#39;m probably willing to walk away with my 3.5 million untaxed plus whatever extra I received after taxes with a smile on my face.<br /><br />Yeah.<br /><br />Whoever started calling this tax &quot;the death tax&quot;, deserves to be lit aflame.<br /><br />edits:<br />I&#39;m also learning a lot about tax law from reading about this.<br /><br />Like: You&#39;re allotted 2 million dollars in tax free gifting over the course of your life.  And another 12,000/year&#33;  And this new tax kicks in on amounts over 3.5 million dollars.<br /><br />Know you&#39;re dying well enough to write a will?  You likely have that 2 mil in gifts left and as many 12k gifts per year as you have years left.<br /><br />So I&#39;d get taxed 0% on a 1million dollar inheritence.  It would take an inheritance of &#36;7,722,222.22 before I&#39;d get taxed a million bucks.<br /><br />If I understand this right:<br />10 mil inheritance is taxed at about 2 million bucks.  20%<br />50 mil inheritance is taxed at about 20 million bucks. 40%<br />100 mil inheritance is taxed at about 42.5 million bucks. 42.5%<br /><br />That&#39;s WAY lower than marginal income tax rates for the same money.  And I&#39;d call it income, but I&#39;m kind of a dick about that sort of thing.<br />		</div>

It isn&#39;t at all related to the implicit dangers of a wealth distribution in which a percentage of the GDP approaching 100 is left in the hands of under 1% of the population.  It&#39;s not related to that being a very fundamental cause of most economic collapses in human history.  It&#39;s about what my family has been able to do with themselves as compared to the much more wealthy and how much I wish that *I* were so lucky.<br /><br />Just because something seems to be something &quot;in all essence&quot; to you does not make it so.  Your income is not taxed because you earned it, it is taxed because it moved.  And it&#39;s almost never about who is moving it, but who it is being moved to.  The state isn&#39;t taxed on your lottery winnings, you are.  You aren&#39;t taxed on the inheritance you leave to your children, they are.  <br /><br />You ask how it is just.  I can easily turn that around and ask why this specific tax is any less just than another.  They all effectively take your money and prevent you from doing as you please with it.<br /><br />Here&#39;s one last thought before I peace for the day.<br /><br />If there were a 0% estate tax, would that discriminate against the infertile?<br />&quot;Sorry, non-procreational citizen.  The state will now confiscate the gift tax rates from your post-humous leavings because you had no children to give it to.  That would have been tax free, you know.  Too bad... really.&quot;		</div>

I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve done worse.<br /><br />There&#39;s at least a &quot;point&quot; in there.  Articulated more directly, why should gifts to your children be taxed less than gifts to the homeless?  Gifts to businesses?  Gifts to your parents?  Cousins?  Uncle?<br /><br />I guess there&#39;s this sort of unspoken attitude where we all dream of being able to hand the world to our children on a silver platter so they can continue our work here on earth while we rest comfortably in the afterlife watching them achieve everything we didn&#39;t have time for.<br /><br />You can go ahead and do that.  Up to ONE MILLION DOLLARS.  Free.  Completely.  Gubmint won&#39;t see a single red penny.  If you can give more than that to your children, you are still welcome to.  It isn&#39;t even taxed as much as regular gifts at that point.  If you don&#39;t believe it should be taxed at all we can have that discussion.  If you believe it should be taxed at a certain rate, that is also a discussion I&#39;d like to have.  But this is not even remotely close to a constructive, pleasant, meaningful or relevant one...<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">In theory, why should some people get taxed twice on what they&#39;ve earned?<br /><br />Under current law, if someone inherits a &#36;5 million estate in 2009, they would pay &#36;675,000 in federal estate taxes, according to an analysis by Deloitte Tax. In 2010, they would pay no estate tax but the estate would be subject to a 15 percent capital gains tax. If they inherit the &#36;5 million estate in 2011, they would pay &#36;2,045,000 in estate taxes, according to the analysis.</div><br /><br />First of all, all money in the united states economy has been taxed thousands of times prior to it&#39;s transition through a will.  One more does not make it twice.  It makes it one more.<br /><br />Second of all, the second part ignores that W. lowered those taxes to historically low levels, and is a completely tangential point to the fundamental validity of the estate tax.<br /><br /><div class="codetop">CODE</div><div class="codemain">2001 	&#36;675,000 	55%<br />2002 	&#36;1 million 	50%<br />2003 	&#36;1 million 	49%<br />2004 	&#36;1.5 million 	48%<br />2005 	&#36;1.5 million 	47%<br />2006 	&#36;2 million 	46%<br />2007 	&#36;2 million 	45%<br />2008 	&#36;2 million 	45%<br />2009 	&#36;3.5 million 	45%<br />2010 * 	Repealed * 	0% *<br />2011 	&#36;1 million 	55%</div><br /><br />So in 2001, when I heard NOTHING about estate taxes, you could only give 675k tax free.  That number was then raised nearly every year until this one, while the actual tax level was revised down.  Repeatedly.  Now, that number has been *raised from what it was not a decade ago and the people are angry.<br /><br />Do you understand now why I&#39;m treating this like a joke?		</div>

It&#39;s hard to understate the role the government plays in guaranteeing and facilitating that transaction.  Particularly if it&#39;s of an amount large enough to qualify for taxation.<br /><br />But the fundamental rationale for the estate tax is that it&#39;s part of the commitment we have to the system of taxation we use.  Without it, progressive taxation falls apart as we can&#39;t exactly tax wealth but only income and transfers.  I guess if you&#39;re interested in having royalty in this country you can go ahead and support unmitigated transfer of wealth to the wealthy.  I for one don&#39;t think that&#39;s either equitable or conducive to a functional society or the economic system that keeps ours running smoothly.<br />		</div>

						It&#39;s just being moved into the possession of a second person.  And again...  I don&#39;t think everyone&#39;s understanding this.  It&#39;s not like they&#39;re pulling %50 of &#36;1000.  It&#39;s over &#36;1 million.  I don&#39;t care how hard anyone worked for it, and whether or not they payed taxes on it.  You have not, if you are receiving it in their will, the person who worked that hard for it, and you certainly didn&#39;t pay taxes on it.  They earned it.  Yes.  They paid taxes on it...  Yes.  You didn&#39;t earn it, you&#39;re just lucky enough to be getting it.  Be happy you&#39;re getting it, suck it up, and pay the fucking taxes.  <br /><br />It&#39;s getting taxed twice, but as Andrew has so handily pointed out, it&#39;s actually been taxed thousands of times.  And it&#39;s not the same person getting taxed on it &quot;twice&quot; anyway.<br /><br />Fuck.<br /><br />Taxes are good, they pay for things like infrastructure, and the military.  So everyone who&#39;s hawkish should be absolutely thrilled about this anyway...  Also forgetting the fact that 10 years ago the threshold was less than &#36;1 million.  Which I don&#39;t think is unreasonable at all.  If my self-made, rich as hell god-father kicks it (god forbid) and leaves all his shit to me (I wouldn&#39;t complain), and it&#39;s over a million, I&#39;m just going to have to console myself with the million plus I picked up instead of crying in my beer about all that other money I didn&#39;t fucking need anyway going to do things that need to be done anyway instead of funding my 5th Porsche.  I&#39;ll survive.  I didn&#39;t earn the fucking money anyway, what makes me deserve it more than a fucking homeless guy?<br /><br />This is like Joe the fucking plumber bitching about how businesses grossing over &#36;250K were going to get taxed at a higher rate because he <i>wanted</i> to be making that much at some time in the future.  Meanwhile the fucking guy wasn&#39;t even an apprentice, and certainly didn&#39;t have his license.  Fucking dream on man, in the meantime enjoy the low income housing you&#39;re living in because businesses grossing over &#36;250k are helping finance with the fucking taxes you&#39;re complaining about.<br />		</div>

						Taking away incentives to make money is never good.

Completely BS argument for the failure that is trickle down supply side voodoo economics is still completely BS.

Because in spite of having more taken away, and this is the key part coming up right here, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they are still making more money.</span>  Making more money is the incentive to make more money.<br /><br />You might notice that the Laffer-Curve, which is what this argument that &quot;too much taxes actually decreases revenues&quot; comes from, is just a bell curve skewed about 30% to the low side.

						I know this is going to be shot down, or someone is going to say why this won&#39;t work, but I believe in a flat tax.

Complete with POW, experience, pandering to the Hillary base, Drilldrilldrilldrill, tax cuts, terrorism, and GASP... 9/fucking/11.<br /><br />&quot;Of great concern to me, during those same four days in Denver, they rarely mentioned the attacks of September 11, 2001. They are in a state of denial about the biggest threat that faces this country. And if you deny it and you don’t deal with it, you can’t face it.<br /><br />John McCain can face the enemy. He can win, and he can bring victory for this country.&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;m literally disgusted.		</div>

						I dunno, I think his point is entirely reasonable; I just think the conclusion he draws is unfounded and a bit irresponsible.<br /><br />9/11 was a big deal, and it really brought threats posed by foreign terrorists into the public mindset.  You cannot dream to address the challenges that poses if you push 9/11 out of your mind.  Now, I don&#39;t agree that the democrats have done that as evidence only by the fact that they didn&#39;t mention it 15 times in each speech, but at least a little bit of substance can be drawn from that speech.<br /><br />However, you also cannot dream to address the challenges that poses by misrepresenting or misunderstanding the situation like Giuliani always does.<br /><br />In general, I wouldn&#39;t take anything Guiliani says to heart.  The fact is, he got demolished in his presidential bid, so it is pretty safe to say most people don&#39;t buy entirely into his bullshit.		</div>

						Currently watching Mccain speak.  I was watching it on public access because I don&#39;t want to hear any of the mainsteam commentary.  The channel i was watching it kept panning to some guy who was holding up giant signs bashing Mccain&#39;s history in voting against vets, or something along those lines.  Don&#39;t know how he made it past security, and he must have gigantic balls to crash the RNC.<br /><br />In other news, Obama gained &#36;10 million in in the wake of Palin&#39;s speech.  It&#39;s only significant because Mccain gained only &#36;1 mil following the speech.  I didn&#39;t see that coming.		</div>

I don&#39;t don&#39;t consider myself to part of the religious right, however, I do tend to agree on average with the republican party more.  Trying to say everyone in the Republican party is part of the religious right is the same as saying everyone on the Democratic side is a gay vegan named Lance, aborting every other pregnancy he sees because he is high and unemployed.  There are extremes on both sides.  I do agree with some aspects of the democratic party platform.  My biggest complaint is that both sides tend to take the extreme on so many issues instead of choosing a middle ground between the two parties that I support.		</div>

						You&#39;re myopic.<br /><br />Let me spell it out for you:<br />Mungo called all protestors at the RNC bull dyke queers.  You jump right on the liberal bashing bandwagon.<br /><br />I called him on his gross generalization by saying that they are perceived as such not because of who they are, but who their audience is.  You proceed to say:<br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Democrats might have a better chance of swaying voters at the RNC if the people that happened to represent them didn&#39;t all look like people that the Conservative right doesn&#39;t already hate on an <b>ideological and religious basis.</b></div><br />Well, they&#39;re democrats.  Conservatives hate them on an ideological and religious basis and therefore can&#39;t every be swayed, by your own logic.<br /><br />Then I suggest that yes, you&#39;re correct, if you act like an ignorant fuck before presenting your argument, then you should be rightfully ignored (see the 9/11 snuff film that preceded the last night of the convention)<br /><br />Then I follow up by asking what about his method of presentation would turn off a rational person from discourse?  I posit it&#39;s because the republican party was hijacked by the religious right.<br /><br />Instead of addressing my points, you attack my supposition.<br /><br />Try again.<br /><br />Also:  what about the INSANITY that was every speech at the RNC.  They pretended the Dems are to blame for 8 years of a bush presidency.  They acted like the surge was working, when by all legitimate metrics, it is failing miserably and our young men are dying.  They insist that Obama wants to tax YOU, when really he wants to lower taxes more for you than McCain will unless you&#39;re making over 111,000 dollars a year, and you STILL get a tax break until you break the &#36;250,000 per annum mark.  It was a series of red-herrings and strawmen.<br /><br />No, it was the guy who had the balls to go into the hornets nest and say something who&#39;s being ignored for good reason.  Yeah, that&#39;s it.<br /><br />edit 4: cause I keep seeing things you wrote and getting pissed.  Anti-abortion = GOP platform         PETA &#33;= Dem Platform.  Nice try though.  There is no democratic platform that can be tied to some insane, immobile ideology.  That&#39;s why they &quot;flip flop&quot;.  Because they listen and<b> can</b> change their fucking minds.		</div>

I live about 30 minutes from the Xcel Center in St Paul where the RNC was held and dealt with the protestors in Minneapolis because that&#39;s where I work. They all looked like they were born at the top of the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. What the hell good does protesting do anyway? If I see a group of people holding up signs, blocking traffic, and shouting crap -- my instant reaction is that they&#39;re a bunch of douchebags. Do they think their point is going to be made by coming off as a bunch of douchebags? It&#39;s totally pointless. Get a job and/or do something productive.<br /><br />Now go whine about me making more vast generalizations, being hypocritical, or blame me for some of your shortcomings in life or something.		</div>

I live about 30 minutes from the Xcel Center in St Paul where the RNC was held and dealt with the protestors in Minneapolis because that&#39;s where I work. They all looked like they were born at the top of the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. What the hell good does protesting do anyway? If I see a group of people holding up signs, blocking traffic, and shouting crap -- my instant reaction is that they&#39;re a bunch of douchebags. Do they think their point is going to be made by coming off as a bunch of douchebags? It&#39;s totally pointless. Get a job and/or do something productive.</div><br /><br />It&#39;s not pointless if they reach 1 voter.  That&#39;s all.  1.  Get a clue and/or shut your pie hole.		</div>

						from another forum<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">GySgt Ableman was keen enough to spot this {fill in the blank} walking through the Reno Airport in full dress blues with gloves and cover on. He stopped him near the baggage claim and running into three Drill Instructors wasn&#39;t something this guy had anticipated. <br /><br />If any of you know Gy Ableman, this kid was lucky to leave with all his teeth intact. From the get go, it was obvious this kid was not a Marine.<br />He claimed to be a PFC (wearing LCpl chevrons) and could not explain what a PFC chevron looked like and then couldn&#39;t explain the NCO stripe on his trousers. He had a collar emblem in the middle of his barracks cover and his belt was sticking out. <br /><br />No ribbons or badges, his trousers were way too long, not to mention he had on Sketcher boots instead of dress shoes and a civilian belt. We found this out after we demanded that he take off the blouse and cover. <br /><br />Turns out he bought the uniform from a surplus store and his Dad is a retired Navy Chief. Reno is a super-pro military area and this guy was soaking in the atta-boys. Lot of posers out there, watch out&#33;</div><br /><br /><br /><img src="http://i91.photobucket.com/albums/k312/cypressrailaz/0630091543.jpg" class="linked-image" alt="image" style="border: 0px;" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i91.photobucket.com/albums/k312/cypressrailaz/0630091543a.jpg" class="linked-image" alt="image" style="border: 0px;" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i91.photobucket.com/albums/k312/cypressrailaz/0630091543b.jpg" class="linked-image" alt="image" style="border: 0px;" />		</div>

						bars and airports seem to be the two bigger spots for these kind of people to show up; here is another story that shows more of what this guy got for dressing up that way<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Date: 20 June 2009<br /><br />Time: 0600<br /><br />Location: Anchorage Intl Airport, Concourse C<br /><br />Walking thru the ANC airport I noticed a soldier with a high and tight wearing BDUâ€™s and OD jungle boots. When he was done with the Customer Service Agent, I approached him and asked if he was really a Ranger and Special Forces soldier? He said yes, I then asked for a picture of a Ranger for my kids, he gladly accepted. We then proceeded to small talk about where he was assigned and what he was doing in Anchorage. I finally told he was full of shit&#33; I showed him my credentials and my Retired ID and told him he was a fake and was possibly violating Federal law and Army Regulations. He started getting in my face and claiming all sorts of stuff. I asked for his ID and he provided me a IL drivers license. He said he was not in the military, but was wearing the uniform to honor his dad. He continued his three step and listed every excuse in the book. I called the Airport PD and turned him over to them, and requested that they call Anchorage PD. I notified the TSA to see if he had used the military line / screening procedures and he had. They then flagged him and his day started to turn bad. I also notified Alaska Airlines and had them flag him for screening and check to see if he had his bags checked with the military exclusion for no baggage fee as well. Last I saw of him was him being led outside of security to the PD Office. I wish I could have followed up but I had a flight to catch. I will post the picture of Mr. Sunshine himself when I get back home&#33; You can not see the 82nd Airborne Combat Patch or the 2nd 75th Scroll with the Ranger and Special Forces Tab UNDER the Scroll&#33; 20 years ago I would have kicked his ass on the spot, now I take the easy road&#33;<br /><br />USASOF<br /><br /><br /><br />Poser Name: Osvaldo Bustamante<br />Address: Chicago, Illinois<br />AKO Address: None Listed<br /><br />UPDATE: Osvald Bustamante was escorted from the secure area was questioned by the Anchorage Airport Police. Check showed no W/W&#39;s, and he was cooperative. He was advised it would be in his best interest to change clothes if he wanted to travel home. He was rescreened by the TSA and received secondary screening at the gate. The crew for his flight was advised of his status and they had no problems. It turns out he checked three bags for free and got a discount ticket because he was in uniform.<br /><br /><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h279/usasof/DSC03387.jpg" class="linked-image" alt="image" style="border: 0px;" /></div>		</div>

						Yeah, I see reports like this on a pretty regular basis on a forum that I am part of, with most of the members being current or former military.  The people love busting posers.  I&#39;m really hoping to get someone one day.  It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen pictures of those two stories and its sad to see just how blatantly wrong their uniforms are.		</div>

These people make me sick.<br /><br />Sorry scabs, people who do this deserve a good ass kicking.</div><br /><br />QFT.  But I also think Military folks are a little over-sensitive to this kind of thing.  The GySgt should&#39;ve just broken down everything that was wrong with this guys outfit right in front of the whole airport, demanded he remove X,Y, and Z.  And been on his way, preferably mumbling about how that kid is a disrespectful prick who could do well from few weeks of bootcamp.  No need to &quot;inform him that he may possibly be violating some federal laws&quot; which he is, of course.<br /><br />These fuckers want attention?  Give it to them.  But it&#39;s nothing sinister, which is what those laws are for.<br /><br />A bigger problem is that apparently dressing as Military means you get saluted instead of patted down at airports.  As though when these guys get home they are completely psychologically intact and always make well informed and thoughtful decisions in public places...  I&#39;d *like* them to not get a free pass by security.  A free extra carry-on?  Sure.  Check it out please.<br /><br /><img src="http://i91.photobucket.com/albums/k312/cypressrailaz/0630091543b.jpg" class="linked-image" alt="image" style="border: 0px;" /><br />See the look in his face?  You won GySgt.  Go catch your flight and forget about this asshat.<br /><br /><br />		</div>

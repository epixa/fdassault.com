						I know, I know.  What does he know?  But, I liked the fact that he goes against what the mainstream Hollywood icons say.<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">VOIGHT: My concerns for America<br />Obama sowing socialist seeds in young people<br /><br />Monday, July 28, 2008<br />Comment<br />Print<br />Listen<br />Font Size Share<br />Ask a Question<br />You Report<br /><br />Actor Jon Voight. Associated Press.<br /><br />OP-ED<br /><br />We, as parents, are well aware of the importance of our teachers who teach and program our children. We also know how important it is for our children to play with good-thinking children growing up.<br /><br />Sen. Barack Obama has grown up with the teaching of very angry, militant white and black people: the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Louis Farrakhan, William Ayers and Rev. Michael Pfleger. We cannot say we are not affected by teachers who are militant and angry. We know too well that we become like them, and Mr. Obama will run this country in their mindset.<br /><br />The Democratic Party, in its quest for power, has managed a propaganda campaign with subliminal messages, creating a God-like figure in a man who falls short in every way. It seems to me that if Mr. Obama wins the presidential election, then Messrs. Farrakhan, Wright, Ayers and Pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralize this country and help create a socialist America.<br /><br />The Democrats have targeted young people, knowing how easy it is to bring forth whatever is needed to program their minds. I know this process well. I was caught up in the hysteria during the Vietnam era, which was brought about through Marxist propaganda underlying the so-called peace movement. The radicals of that era were successful in giving the communists power to bring forth the killing fields and slaughter 2.5 million people in Cambodia and South Vietnam. Did they stop the war, or did they bring the war to those innocent people? In the end, they turned their backs on all the horror and suffering they helped create and walked away.<br /><br />Those same leaders who were in the streets in the &#39;60s are very powerful today in their work to bring down the Iraq war and to attack our president, and they have found their way into our schools. William Ayers is a good example of that.<br /><br />Thank God, today, we have a strong generation of young soldiers who know exactly who they are and what they must do to protect our freedom and our democracy. And we have the leadership of Gen. David Petraeus, who has brought hope and stability to Iraq and prevented the terrorists from establishing a base in that country. Our soldiers are lifting us to an example of patriotism at a time when we&#39;ve almost forgotten who we are and what is at stake.<br /><br />If Mr. Obama had his way, he would have pulled our troops from Iraq years ago and initiated an unprecedented bloodbath, turning over that country to the barbarianism of our enemies. With what he has openly stated about his plans for our military, and his lack of understanding about the true nature of our enemies, there&#39;s not a cell in my body that can accept the idea that Mr. Obama can keep us safe from the terrorists around the world, and from Iran, which is making great strides toward getting the atomic bomb. And while a misleading portrait of Mr. Obama is being perpetrated by a media controlled by the Democrats, the Obama camp has sent out people to attack the greatness of Sen. John McCain, whose suffering and courage in a Hanoi prison camp is an American legend.<br /><br />Gen. Wesley Clark, who himself has shame upon him, having been relieved of his command, has done their bidding and become a lying fool in his need to demean a fellow soldier and a true hero.<br /><br />This is a perilous time, and more than ever, the world needs a united and strong America. If, God forbid, we live to see Mr. Obama president, we will live through a socialist era that America has not seen before, and our country will be weakened in every way.<br /><br />Jon Voight is an Academy Award-winning actor who is well-known for his humanitarian work.</div>		</div>

						Alright, here it goes.  For the sake of this discussion, I will assume he isn&#39;t simply mentally challenged (although that would really explain the entire piece).<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">We, as parents, are well aware of the importance of our teachers who teach and program our children. We also know how important it is for our children to play with good-thinking children growing up.<br /><br />Sen. Barack Obama has grown up with the teaching of very angry, militant white and black people: the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Louis Farrakhan, William Ayers and Rev. Michael Pfleger. We cannot say we are not affected by teachers who are militant and angry. We know too well that we become like them, and Mr. Obama will run this country in their mindset.</div><br /><br />For one, assuming that the negatives of people surrounding you as you grow will inherently brush off on you is simply wrong.  Obviously poor personality traits, habits, or opinions of those close to them can be adopted by children, they certainly don&#39;t have to be.  In fact, children often have the exact opposite reaction to the negatives of those around them: they aspire <i>not</i> to be like that.  My mother smoked her entire life, and as a direct result of me seeing her do that, I will never even so much as think about smoking one of those death sticks.<br /><br />Secondly, Voight is making a drastic assumption about Obama&#39;s relationships with the aforementioned people.  Having a crazy-ass reverend doesn&#39;t make you crazy.  Hell, having a crazy-ass best friend that hangs out with you every day doesn&#39;t make you crazy.  If anything, it can show how understanding and patient you can be.  This whole guilty-by-association nonsense is completely misleading and 100% subjective.<br /><br />Finally, he conveniently forgets to mention the thousands of other people that have impacted Obama&#39;s life and his upbringing.  He forgets to mention his working-class roots -- how his father came to this country seeking out the American dream and worked his butt off every day to provide for his family, put them through school, and send them off into the real world without an ounce of help from those power hungry socialist democrats.  No, to Voight, apparently the flaws of a few people in Obama&#39;s life clearly make him a detriment to everyone around him.<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">The Democratic Party, in its quest for power, has managed a propaganda campaign with subliminal messages, creating a God-like figure in a man who falls short in every way. It seems to me that if Mr. Obama wins the presidential election, then Messrs. Farrakhan, Wright, Ayers and Pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralize this country and help create a socialist America.</div><br /><br />Oh no&#33;  The DEMOCRATIC MACHINE IS TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;  Seriously?  I don&#39;t consider myself a democrat.  In fact, I lean far to the right of most of their domestic policies.  But to assume that either party is behind some conspiratorial effort to demoralize the country to push a new government system is ridiculous.  I like to think I lean right because I&#39;m a rational person who has really thought about the issues; I really wish nut-jobs like Voight wouldn&#39;t tarnish the views I have like he is with extremist nonsense like this.<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">The Democrats have targeted young people, knowing how easy it is to bring forth whatever is needed to program their minds.

Did they stop the war, or did they bring the war to those innocent people? In the end, they turned their backs on all the horror and suffering they helped create and walked away.</div><br /><br />Did it ever occur to him that perhaps young people are drawn to democrats not because of some national brainwashing initiative but instead because the democratic platform happens to be extremely friendly to young voters?  Besides, the DNC doesn&#39;t &quot;target&quot; young voters in the way they target elderly voters or anything along those lines.  Young voters, even in the most exciting elections, always have low turnout.  Always&#33;  Plus, they simply don&#39;t have the numbers to make up a significant demographic when you compare them to their baby-boomer parents.<br /><br />I&#39;d also like to point out that Vietnam isn&#39;t doing bad.  We left, bad shit happened, and the country recovered.  Compare that to Korea, where we didn&#39;t leave, and we&#39;re still there, and the most heavily armed border in the world splits the country into two parts that would explode in conflict if we ever decided to drop our support of the south.<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Those same leaders who were in the streets in the &#39;60s are very powerful today in their work to bring down the Iraq war and to attack our president, and they have found their way into our schools. William Ayers is a good example of that.</div><br /><br />And those people actually control the brains of the other 99.9% of society?  I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t need a teacher to tell me why to attack my president.  I have plenty to attack him on based exclusively on his own actions.<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Thank God, today, we have a strong generation of young soldiers who know exactly who they are and what they must do to protect our freedom and our democracy.

Our soldiers are lifting us to an example of patriotism at a time when we&#39;ve almost forgotten who we are and what is at stake.</div><br /><br />I agree whole-heartedly with this paragraph, but I don&#39;t really see how this in support for McCain.  Thank God we have a strong generation of soldiers who protect our freedom and our democracy <i>by donating all of their money to Obama so he can actually attempt to be diplomatic and end unnecessary injury and strife</i>.  Thank God we have the leadership of General David Petraeus, who has done the best he could under extremely awful circumstances.  It&#39;s a shame he had to focus so much of his energies keeping Al Qaeda from creating a base in a country that was once a very strong opponent of Al Qaeda while Al Qaeda moved right back into the country that was really the problem all along&#33;<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">If Mr. Obama had his way, he would have pulled our troops from Iraq years ago and initiated an unprecedented bloodbath, turning over that country to the barbarianism of our enemies.

As compare to who?  McCain?  John McCain is the one that thought Iraq would be a cake-walk.  John McCain is the one who can&#39;t explain the fundamental differences between Shia and Sunni.  John McCain is the one that pushed our troops into this hell-hole with trumpets blazing because he thought the best way to defeat Al Qaeda was to decimate one of their only enemies in the region.  John McCain barely knows who our enemies are much less what their nature is or how to best combat them.<br /><br /><i>No one</i> with any relation to the Obama campaign is attacking John McCain&#39;s war record.  What he endured in service to his country was incredibly courageous, and Obama has expressed his sincere gratitude for that service on many occasions.  Hell, I don&#39;t really know <i>anyone</i> that is trashing McCain&#39;s war record.  The only thing I&#39;ve ever heard (and not even from the Obama campaign) that questioned something related to McCain&#39;s service in Vietnam was how it prepared him to be the President of the United States.  Personally, I think that is about as valid of a question as it gets, and I would love an answer to it.<br /><br />And I can&#39;t resist remarking on the &quot;legend&quot; comment.  John McCain is not a legend.  He never will be a legend.  To call him a legend, we would also have to call his co-pilot a legend (but I doubt anyone here, including myself, could even name him).  We&#39;d have to call everyone that suffered the horrors of detainment in the Vietnam war (or any other war for that matter) a legend.  Legendary is a strong term, and one that very few people, including John McCain, are worthy of.<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Gen.

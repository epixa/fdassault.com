						to give you scale, ANunes, a &quot;ten thousand pound bomb&quot; (also known as an &quot;arc light bomb&quot; in the military) is a large cannister with 5 tons of LP/LNG in it dropped from a C-130 or similar aircraft with a proximity trigger on it.<br /><br />An arc light, used in Desert Storm, was dropped 22 miles away from me, and yet, for about 30 seconds, it was daylight bright where we were.<br /><br />A LNG boat typically ships 500-1000 tons of the stuff, I believe...and an arc light is used to level small to medium villages (small to medium in Iraqui terms, anyhow, dunno how that fits into American town size, but an LNG boat could easily ruin a whole harbor if it went &quot;boom&quot;)		</div>

						it&#39;s this kind of nonsense that should make everyone question the validity of the war.

						Ok.  I concede that Islamo-fascism extends beyond the middle east.  Any time an entire culture can be made out to be victims there will be worldwide (if not widespread) support for them.  I mean we will never ever ever march an army into Germany to root out the terrorists.  And there are other kinds of terrorists besides the Islamic ones.  It&#39;s the most inconsistent campaign possible.  Whether it&#39;s a war for oil is, of course, debatable.  But what is abundantly clear to me is that it ISN&#39;T a war on terror.<br /><br />In Iraq we&#39;ve seen it heralded as a necessary precaution against WMD&#39;s that could fall into terrorist hands under Hussein&#39;s irresponsible rule.  No WMD&#39;s.  We&#39;ve seen it heralded as a war against tyranny as we toppled a cruel and militant dictator.  We&#39;ve seen it heralded as a neighborly responsibility to our comrades in the region to leave the country stable after doing all this.  We&#39;re not fighting terrorists over there from what I&#39;ve heard and read and seen.  We&#39;re protecting our soldiers and allies from the terrorists that happen to be there.  <br /><br />It&#39;s like this:<br />Some dude threatens to stab your family.  Do you<br />A- Sit in your house with a shotgun and wait<br />B- Leave your family and look for the guy<br /><br />If you chose B you&#39;re missing the point.  If I&#39;m not home I can&#39;t guarantee my family&#39;s safety.  If I&#39;m hunting some homicidal asshole I can&#39;t guarantee my safety either, and if I die I certainly can&#39;t help my family.<br /><br />So by my thinking they are not only failing to offer me adequate protection.  They are spending a SHITLOAD of money doing it, and killing a significant number of innocents as well as getting our guys killed.  It doesn&#39;t even make political sense given current approval ratings.  I can&#39;t think of a justification that I can attribute to what I believe to be a farily intelligent group of leaders except that it&#39;s in our best interest not just to root out terrorists for our physical security, but almost more importantly to improve the stability in Iraq.  And since the only things Iraq has been able to offer are intolerance and oil... I&#39;ve bought into the theory that we&#39;re not trying to import the intolerance.		</div>

Do you<br />A- Sit in your house with a shotgun and wait<br />B- Leave your family and look for the guy<br /><br />If you chose B you&#39;re missing the point.  If I&#39;m not home I can&#39;t guarantee my family&#39;s safety.  If I&#39;m hunting some homicidal asshole I can&#39;t guarantee my safety either, and if I die I certainly can&#39;t help my family.<br /><br />So by my thinking they are not only failing to offer me adequate protection.  They are spending a SHITLOAD of money doing it, and killing a significant number of innocents as well as getting our guys killed.</div><br />I would think of your example like this:<br />The guy wants to kill you really badly no matter where you are and he doesnt care if he kills the people around you in the process.  Do you stay home to fight him and let there be the possibility that he blows up your house and your family because you are there?  Or do you announce that you are going to be leaving and will be willing to face himm away from your family?<br /><br />and.. we are fighting the terrorists over there.  Al Qaida claims Iraq is their number 1 front.  Osama bin Laden wants Baghdad to be the capital of his Islamic caliphate.<br />		</div>

						What Osama Bin-Laden wants, what Al-Qaeda claims, are not necessarily reality.<br /><br />And why would you announce that you are going to face them away from your family?  That&#39;s just asking for them to go straight to your loved ones.  You said it yourself... these are terrorists.  What makes you believe anything they say.  And what makes you think they won&#39;t blow your house up just because you aren&#39;t there.<br /><br />9/11 was an attack on civilians designed to send a message to our leadership.  It worked and we are running the risk of playing right into their hands.		</div>

Oh thats right, the great satan America.<br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">My raising this idea-I don&#39;t claim that it&#39;s infallible-is only to stress something extremely important. And it is that the mujahedeen must not have their mission end with the expulsion of the Americans from Iraq, and then lay down their weapons, and silence the fighting zeal. We will return to having the secularists and traitors holding sway over us. Instead, their ongoing mission is to establish an Islamic state, and defend it, and for every generation to hand over the banner to the one after it until the Hour of Resurrection.</div><br />= leaving the Middle East entirely will not placate them as Paulnuts believe<br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">If we look at the two short-term goals, which are removing the Americans and establishing an Islamic amirate in Iraq, or a caliphate if possible, then, we will see that the strongest weapon which the mujahedeen enjoy - after the help and granting of success by God - is popular support from the Muslim masses in Iraq, and the surrounding Muslim countries.</div><br />Nope, I definitely do not want AQ to gain in popularity.<br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">My answer is, firstly: Things may develop faster than we imagine. The aftermath of the<br />collapse of American power in Vietnam-and how they ran and left their agents-is noteworthy.</div><br />The US is a paper tiger.<br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">For that reason, many of your Muslim admirers amongst the common folk are wondering about your attacks on the Shia. The sharpness of this questioning increases when the attacks are on one of their mosques, and it increases more when the attacks are on the mausoleum of Imam Ali Bin Abi Talib, may God honor him. My opinion is that this matter won&#39;t be acceptable to the Muslim populace however much you have tried to explain it, and aversion to this will continue.<br /><br />Indeed, questions will circulate among mujahedeen circles and their opinion makers about the correctness of this conflict with the Shia at this time. Is it something that is unavoidable? Or, is it something can be put off until the force of the mujahed movement in Iraq gets stronger? And if some of the operations were necessary for self-defense, were all of the operations necessary? Or, were there some operations that weren&#39;t called for? And is the opening of another front now in addition to the front against the Americans and the government a wise decision? Or, does this conflict with the Shia lift the burden from the Americans by diverting the mujahedeen to the Shia, while the Americans continue to control matters from afar? And if the attacks on Shia leaders were necessary to put a stop to their plans, then why were there attacks on ordinary Shia? Won&#39;t this lead to reinforcing false ideas in their minds, even as it is incumbent on us to preach the call of Islam to them and explain and communicate to guide them to the truth? And can the mujahedeen kill all of the Shia in Iraq? Has any Islamic state in history ever tried that? And why kill ordinary Shia considering that they are forgiven because of their ignorance? And what loss will befall us if we did not attack the Shia? And do the brothers forget that we have more than one hundred prisoners - many of whom are from the leadership who are wanted in their countries - in the custody of the Iranians? And even if we attack the Shia out of necessity, then why do you announce this matter and make it public, which compels the Iranians to take counter measures? And do the brothers forget that both we and the Iranians need to refrain from harming each other at this time in which the Americans are targeting us?</div><br />AQ and Iran willing to work together.<br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Among the things which the feelings of the Muslim populace who love and support you will never find palatable - also- are the scenes of slaughtering the hostages. You shouldn&#39;t be deceived by the praise of some of the zealous young men and their description of you as the shaykh of the slaughterers, etc. They do not express the general view of the admirer and the supporter of the resistance in Iraq, and of you in particular by the favor and blessing of God.<br /><br />And your response, while true, might be: Why shouldn&#39;t we sow terror in the hearts of the Crusaders and their helpers? And isn&#39;t the destruction of the villages and the cities on the heads of their inhabitants more cruel than slaughtering? And aren&#39;t the cluster bombs and the seven ton bombs and the depleted uranium bombs crueler than slaughtering? And isn&#39;t killing by torture crueler than slaughtering? And isn&#39;t violating the honor of men and women more painful and more destructive than slaughtering?<br /><br />All of these questions and more might be asked, and you are justified. However this does not change the reality at all, which is that the general opinion of our supporter does not comprehend that, and that this general opinion falls under a campaign by the malicious, perfidious, and fallacious campaign by the deceptive and fabricated media. And we would spare the people from the effect of questions about the usefulness of our actions in the hearts and minds of the general opinion that is essentially sympathetic to us.</div><br />No wonder the people of Iraq turned on him and formed the Awakening Councils.		</div>

						Anunes, I don&#39;t know how young you are, but if you&#39;re over 25 you should remember that the war in Iraq is <i>separate</i> from the war on terror, our presence at this time is because of our fears of the results of a civil war in the region, we complete our objective with the overthrow of Hussein and the Ba&#39;athist regime, we were <i>asked</i> by the UN to maintain a presence to avoid local civil war, and have maintained our presence beyond that original request while attempting to back and shore up the new government, while allowing it to establish itself firmly enough to survive. The insurgency is part of the group that wants to topple the new IRAQI government and install one of their own, against majority rule (the current government was democratically elected under interim government election process), they&#39;re targeting <i>us</i> partially because we&#39;re preventing that.		</div>

						Oh no doubt they thought there was something more...we had &quot;good&quot; intelligence from Egypt that had Hussein trying to sell WMD components and products to Egyptian &quot;terrorist&quot; cells. Information that later turned out to be smoke and mirrors, and possibly manufactured as part of a US operation (in which case this wasn&#39;t &quot;conspiracy&quot;, but was a case of one hand not knowing what the other was up to), this is true, but we <i>did</i> <b>know</b> of violations of the agreement, which was reason enough to justify our action under international law, even if the <i>rest</i> of the reasons given were so much B.S. (which, I admit, many of them were &quot;aimed at the gut, not the mind&quot; attempts to get the majority who won&#39;t think with anything else, or who have short memories...this <i>was</i> 10 years after the fact, after all, and &quot;ancient history&quot; in the eyes of the second biggest group of voters (the young voters) in the nation).<br /><br />But what I&#39;m saying is we had <i><b>valid</b></i> reason, we had <i><b>rational</b></i> reason, and we had <i><b>legal</b></i> reason to start this up...after that, I question whether we should have agreed to stay in place, or whether we should have told the U.N. to staff it with Internat&#39;l troops, if they were so concerned with propping up a &quot;democratic form of government in Iraq&quot; that may or may not be feasible.<br /><br />Dick Cheny himself stated that Iraq and Afghanistan are just the first steps in &quot;the endless war at the end of the petroleum age&quot;...he may be right, we may NOT be able to stay out of conflict once we hit the &quot;Hubbard Peak&quot; of oil production, which is projected to be no later than 2010 (and likely already happened) at this stage of technological development. Then again, with oil companies showing record profits, maybe the expense of producing a barrel of oil has <i>not</i> yet increased to the point projected by Hubbard.<br /><br />Unquestionably, soon enough we&#39;ll reach the point where it becomes progressively more expensive to extract the same amount of oil from the Earth (we&#39;re only able to skim off the top 30% of the world&#39;s known oil reserves at current levels of technology, and even with this new record-breaking reserve found in Brazil, we&#39;ll consume it in snap time...with better technology we could pump more out, cheaper, but it hasn&#39;t happened yet...I&#39;m betting it <i>will</i> shortly after the Hubbard peak makes itself known in retrospect, as oil companies try to keep a major market share while new technology, such as the HHO engine that uses solar power to turn water into HHO (note, not hydrogen and oxygen, but a new configuration of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom which forms a gas that burns exothermically and returns to water form...it takes more energy to produce than it produces itself, of course, but this is true of <i>every</i> renewable resource, by definition, but the power supplied is solar electricity, of which we can have a surplus simply by farming our deserts, which is already being done in CA for a large percentage of their total electrical consumption...this just more efficiently turns solar power to usable energy than direct conversion of solar-to-electricity) makes an inroad...either the oil companies will change to producing these new fuels, they&#39;ll use new technology to try to retain their &quot;market share&quot; of energy production, with ever more failing efforts until they go &quot;extinct&quot;, or they&#39;ll just fold as new technology successfully replaces them instead of supporting them...it doesn&#39;t matter which, it&#39;ll be an economic &quot;bump&quot; in the road, no worse than  the Depression, no better then the 1970&#39;s oil recession...we may be in political chaos and conflict as a result of oil barons losing their hold on the world, but it&#39;s nothing &quot;serious&quot; to worry about...we&#39;ll get through it, as a race, and probably as a Nation, as well.		</div>

						Now I was a bit young to care too much at the outset.  That&#39;s how long this shits been going down.  So I don&#39;t remember it all TOO clearly.  But I don&#39;t remember thinking the reasons were very rational.  The official deal had to do with Hussein&#39;s failure to cooperate with weapons inspectors, right?  He had some agency he made up to monitor the inspectors, he denied having or making weapons and we had seen evidence that at the very least he was trying to make something.  All well and good reasons to forcibly go in and police the situation.  <br /><br />Reasons throughout the process:<br />1) Ensure that Iraq doesn&#39;t have WMD&#39;s and eliminate the country&#39;s capability to make them.<br />later<br />2) Unseat the tyrannical ruler who was not in fact making the WMD&#39;s.  (this is my big problem, &quot;He doesn&#39;t have wmds after all&#33;  Well... as long as we&#39;re here...&quot;  It&#39;s bullshit.<br />then<br />3) We have freed the people of Iraq.  Violence will be high for a while during the transition. We should stay the course.<br />4) There have been votes and an elected official has been selected&#33;  We will oversee this governments development and protect its leaders.  We should stay the course.<br />5) Violence is down.  The war is working.  We should stay the course.<br />6) Violence is up.  If we leave now it will be a disaster.  We should stay the course.<br />7) Bad Guy X has been caught.  Only 929028 terrorists to go&#33;  We should stay the course.<br />8) Good Guy X has been killed in action.  We would be doing him/her a dishonor to leave now.  We should stay the course.<br /><br />So based on the less than stellar record of spinning everything into whatever it needs at the time, I don&#39;t know why we should believe anything they&#39;ve ever said really.  As for the REAL reasons.  The official reasons.  I don&#39;t think they were justification for war.  We were scared and angry.  We didn&#39;t go to war with Russia when they WERE setting WMD&#39;s up in our backyard.  What happened to responsible leadership and accountability?		</div>

						Good questions, all....I still agree with unseating Hussein, but then again, I thought we should do it back in &#39;91, when I was over there, and got stopped by an &quot;emergency halt&quot; less than 50 miles from Baghdad, while Hussein pleaded with the U.N. to stop &quot;that nasty coalition that was knocking on his front door&quot;.<br /><br />What I don&#39;t agree with is our continued presence over there, that&#39;s the U.N.&#39;s responsibility now (or should be), and the continuous &quot;breeding&quot; of excuses to maintain such a presence.		</div>

						I don&#39;t understand what the big deal about finding WMDs was.  So we didn&#39;t find them, is that really a big surprise?  When you have an entire country to hide them in, and a government ruled by fear and brutality, its pretty easy to make things disappear.  We know he had WMDs.  He used them countless times against his own people, killing tens of thousands of his own citizens.  Trying to say &quot;We never saw WMDs so he must not have them&quot; is retarded.  No one ever enforced his getting rid of them.  There was never any record of how many he had, and he never let anyone into the country to double check that he was doing what the UN told him to do.<br />		</div>

						So what you&#39;re saying, Phey, is that the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence.  Maybe that there are known knowns and known unknowns, but that it&#39;s important to also recognize the existence of unknown unknowns.  Things we don&#39;t know that we don&#39;t know. <img src="src" alt="image" />/tongue.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid=":P" border="0" alt="tongue.gif" /&gt;<br />[post]<br />My problem is that I don&#39;t think we actually went there for the WMDs.  I think that word was said the thousands upon thousands of times it was said in the months leading up to our invasion of Iraq for no other reason than to rabble-rouse the US into caring enough to keep us quiet long enough to get us entrenched in a country that it perceived (falsely) as vital to our economic survival, but more importantly to their bottom line.<br /><br />There.  There&#39;s my crazy conspiracy theory that I&#39;ve been trying to avoid saying.		</div>

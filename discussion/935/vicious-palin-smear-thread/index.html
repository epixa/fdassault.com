						This is the attitude of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">all</span> most politicians now-a-days.  It isn&#39;t a new mentality, either.  The &quot;rulers&quot; always thought they were above the general population.  The people in Washington are hardly the average Joe.  If we set the system back to the way it initially was (congress as an unpaid position).  The population would actually benefit greatly.  That is never going to happen.<br /><br />What could happen is a revolution of sorts.  The population taking it on themselves to be the government watchdogs.  We all know how good the media has been at that job.  Also, bringing in third parties and independents into the spot light could help tremendously.  If people who haven&#39;t played the republican/democrat game to get ahead got public support (Ron Paul?), then the parties would have to start thinking of changing their tune.<br /><br />As it stands now, the last worry of a politician are the people he/she was elected to serve.		</div>

I would dispute the medical records part because McCain released like 128 pages of stuff and Obama&#39;s records were only a few pages (yes I know he is healthier anyway).  Also, I&#39;m not so sure about him releasing lists of all his donors.  Yes all are listed, but the method might not actually indicate who is part of certain groups listed etc (I can look it up if you care).<br /><br />And about Palin..  As Governor she was fine with the bipartisan committee handling the investigation, but as VP candidate the McCain handlers are who stepped in and slowed down the whole investigation.  So it wasnt necessarily an indication of her unwillingness to participate/willingness to hide things.<br />		</div>

						M.C. Cain released his medical records (yes, 100+ pages) for a limited time, in a closed room.  That seemed a bit fishy to me.<br /><br />As for Obama, his biggest flaw (to me that is) is that he voted 97% with his party line.  He may have a good reason for that, but it suggest he doesn&#39;t think too much for himself.  This is also a McCain problem as well.  McCain voted with G.W. 95% of the time.  Not too maverick-y.		</div>

						hardy har har found more dirt on Obama&#39;s fundraising reporting.  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.newsmax.com/timmerman/Obama_fundraising_illegal/2008/09/29/135718.html" target="_blank">http://www.newsmax.com/timmerman/Obama_fun.../29/135718.html</a><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Unlike the McCain campaign, which has made its complete donor database available online, the Obama campaign has not identified donors for nearly half the amount he has raised, according to the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP). <br /><br /><br />Federal law does not require the campaigns to identify donors who give less than &#36;200 during the election cycle. However, it does require that campaigns calculate running totals for each donor and report them once they go beyond the &#36;200 mark. <br /><br /><br />Surprisingly, the great majority of Obama donors never break the &#36;200 threshold. <br /><br /><br />“Contributions that come under &#36;200 aggregated per person are not listed,” said Bob Biersack, a spokesman for the FEC. “They don’t appear anywhere, so there’s no way of knowing who they are.” <br /><br /><b><br />The FEC breakdown of the Obama campaign has identified a staggering &#36;222.7 million as coming from contributions of &#36;200 or less. Only &#36;39.6 million of that amount comes from donors the Obama campaign has identified. <br /><br /><br />It is the largest pool of unidentified money that has ever flooded into the U.S. election system</b>, before or after the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reforms of 2002.</div><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">In a letter dated June 25, 2008, the FEC asked the Obama campaign to verify a series of &#36;25 donations from a contributor identified as “Will, Good” from Austin, Texas. <br /><br /><br />Mr. Good Will listed his employer as “Loving” and his profession as “You.” <br /><br /><br />A Newsmax analysis of the 1.4 million individual contributions in the latest master file for the Obama campaign discovered <b>1,000 separate entries for Mr. Good Will, most of them for &#36;25. <br /><br /><br />In total, Mr. Good Will gave &#36;17,375.</b> <br /><br /><br />Following this and subsequent FEC requests, campaign records show that 330 contributions from Mr. Good Will were credited back to a credit card. But the most recent report, filed on Sept. 20, showed a net cumulative balance of &#36;8,950 -- still well over the &#36;4,600 limit. <br /><br /><br />There can be no doubt that the Obama campaign noticed these contributions, since Obama’s Sept. 20 report specified that Good Will’s cumulative contributions since the beginning of the campaign were &#36;9,375. <br /><br /><br />In an e-mailed response to a query from Newsmax, <b>Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt pledged that the campaign would return the donations.</b></div><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Similarly, <b>a donor identified as “Pro, Doodad,” from “Nando, NY,” gave &#36;19,500 in 786 separate donations</b>, most of them for &#36;25. For most of these donations, Mr. Doodad Pro listed his employer as “Loving” and his profession as “You,” just as Good Will had done. <br /><br /><br />But in some of them, he didn’t even go this far, apparently picking letters at random to fill in the blanks on the credit card donation form. In these cases, he said he was employed by “VCX” and that his profession was “VCVC.” <br /><br /><br />Following FEC requests, the Obama campaign began refunding money to Doodad Pro in February 2008. In all, about &#36;8,425 was charged back to a credit card. But that still left a net total of &#36;11,165 as of Sept. 20, way over the individual limit of &#36;4,600. <br /><br /><br />Here again, <b>LaBolt pledged that the contributions would be returned </b>but gave no date. <br /><br /><br />In February, after just 93 donations, Doodad Pro had already gone over the &#36;2,300 limit for the primary. He was over the &#36;4,600 limit for the general election one month later. <br /><br /><br />In response to FEC complaints, the Obama campaign began refunding money to Doodad Pro even before he reached these limits. But his credit card was the gift that kept on giving. His most recent un-refunded contributions were on July 7, when he made 14 separate donations, apparently by credit card, of &#36;25 each.</div><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">The FEC has compiled a separate database of potentially questionable overseas donations that contains more than 11,500 contributions totaling &#36;33.8 million. More than 520 listed their “state” as “IR,” often an abbreviation for Iran. Another 63 listed it as “UK,” the United Kingdom.</div><br />-any donations by foreigners are illegal (must be US citizen like a diplomat or soldier and most Obama overseas contributors are)<br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">In July and August, the head of the Nigeria’s stock market held a series of pro-Obama fundraisers in Lagos, Nigeria’s largest city. The events attracted local Nigerian business owners. <br /><br /><br />At one event, a table for eight at one fundraising dinner went for &#36;16,800. Nigerian press reports claimed sponsors raked in an estimated &#36;900,000. <br /><br /><br />The sponsors said the fundraisers were held to help Nigerians attend the Democratic convention in Denver. But the Nigerian press expressed skepticism of that claim, and the Nigerian public anti-fraud commission is now investigating the matter.</div>		</div>

						That said a whole lot of nothing...  I read that it isn&#39;t Obama&#39;s job to figure out all of the &lt;200 dollar donors, of which there are, &quot;a staggering &#36;222.7 million&quot;.  But at the same time it&#39;s inconceivable that Obama didn&#39;t notice &#36;9,000...   bullshit.<br /><br />9,000/222,700,000 = 9/222,700  how could he miss that&#33;<br /><br />Also, people making up fake names and donating to him is not his fault.  And he&#39;s doing, and more importantly, he has done what he can when he can to get all that money straightened out.  The very fact that he can manage &quot;the largest pool of unidentified money that has ever flooded into the U.S. election system&quot; speaks volumes about his managerial skills.<br /><br />/spun<br />/but seriously, that&#39;s newsmax man... newsmax...  look at the ads to see how stupid they think you are and then ask yourself, &quot;am I this stupid?&quot;		</div>

						I just read a BBC article about how the UK will start introducing very basic sex education to students at the age of 5, and it reminded me of an ad that McCain put out about Obama saying that he supported sex education for 5 year olds.<br /><br />So my question is, why is that a problem?  I&#39;m not specifically referring to Obama&#39;s view on it (anyone that actually read up on that ad knows that &#39;sex educaiton&#39; was probably far too strong of a word to describe what Obama supports), but just in general.  I mean, sexual reproduction is probably the most fundamental and basic action of all living things.  We&#39;re totally fine with talking about it in terms of other animals (we call that &quot;mating&quot;), but when we mention it with humans, it&#39;s like this incredibly taboo subject.  It makes perfect sense to me as an atheist to teach kids about sex from as early as they possibly can understand it, but I even struggle to understand the religious justification for not teaching kids about it.  Except in the most extreme and short-lived religions, everyone has sex.		</div>

						I think the fear of teaching kids about sex isn&#39;t so much about worrying about the kids (as much as we&#39;d like to pretend it is) as protecting ourselves from the embarassment of having to talk about it in front of people that aren&#39;t our peers.  Do you talk about sex with your parents?  Even in sex ed in high school, it was mostly unpleasant having to discuss that shit with the teachers.  This is, of course, a function of the problem you wish to solve by teaching kids about it earlier, but still, I think that&#39;s why we don&#39;t do it.  Teachers don&#39;t want to (and they&#39;re unionized), Parents don&#39;t want them to (because they don&#39;t want their little girl coming home after first grade and asking about penises), and kids don&#39;t have a voice.  The scientific community is treated like everybody else, even though they are probably the most well informed and therefore... well... correct body to consult.  So the majority wins.<br /><br />I&#39;d start teaching my kids about sex about as early as they could talk.  Nothing weird of course.  Just the basic talk about where babies come from.  Then when you have to bring up contraception a few years down the road they&#39;re not just tuning you out.<br /><br />Oh and I&#39;d tell them to ignore everything they learned in sex ed.  I don&#39;t want them trying to sneak in abstinence only shit into my kids head.		</div>

						making kids aware of sex leads to masturbation and masturbators are evil perverts who are dangerous to society.<br /><br />but seriously barring the religious reasons not to (i would have to get a lobotomy to fully appreciate the ridiculousness) i would think censorship to be the only other obvious reason.<br /><br />and if you&#39;re too big of a pussy to talk to your child about it, maybe you shouldn&#39;t have had one in the first place.

Alas, I believe that the opening line was sarcasm, but I&#39;d like to build upon it further.<br /><br />Morals are personal.  The facts should be presented and that should be that.  Condoms are effect measures to protect against STDs (or VDs, whatever they decide to call them).  I think it was funny when I had to take &quot;Sex Ed&quot;.  The teacher walked a fine line.  He kept promoting condoms, but always followed with a quick &quot;...,but the only way to guarantee it is abstinence&quot;.  It was obvious that he added that last bit because he would jeopardize his job otherwise.		</div>

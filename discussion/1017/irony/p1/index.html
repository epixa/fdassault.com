Perhaps Renzi would like to go back in time to revise his many votes in favor of the Bush Administration&#39;s domestic surveillance activities.<br /><br />Last week, more wiretapping abuses were revealed, as noted by Glenn Greenwald, and of course, widely ignored by the corporate broadcast media:<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">In the most unsurprising revelation imaginable, two former Army Reserve Arab linguists for the National Security Agency have said that they routinely eavesdropped on --- &quot;and recorded and transcribed&quot; --- the private telephone calls of American citizens who had absolutely nothing to do with terrorism. The two former NSA employees, who came forward as part of journalist James Bamford&#39;s forthcoming book on the NSA, intercepted calls as part of the so-called &quot;Terrorist Surveillance Program,&quot; whereby George Bush ordered the NSA in 2001 to eavesdrop on Americans&#39; calls in secret, without first obtaining judicial approval as required by the law (FISA). That illegal eavesdropping continued for at least six years --- through 2007.<br />...<br />Faulk told Ross: &quot;when one of my co-workers went to a supervisor and said: &#39;but sir, there are personal calls,&#39; the supervisor said: &#39;my orders were to transcribe everything&#39;.&quot; He said that the intercepted calls included highly personal and intimate conversations and even phone sex.</div><br /><br />One final note: if broad, unchecked domestic spying powers led to &quot;unintentional&quot; wiretapping of the Republican Congressional leadership&#39;s strategy sessions in a case unrelated to their organizational planning, it does beg the question of how many secret wiretaps have led to surveillance on Democratic leadership strategy sessions.</div>		</div>

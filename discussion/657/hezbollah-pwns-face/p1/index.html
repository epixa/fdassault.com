						I liked the extra information and all, but I really haven&#39;t seen anything that connects Iran to Hezbollah beyond a bunch of coincidental stuff.  I read <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.usip.org/pubs/usipeace_briefings/2006/0922_iran_hezbollah.html" target="_blank">this</a>, but basically came away with, &quot;because Iran would benefit from some of Hezbollah&#39;s actions and policies, they are intrinsically related, and in fact are supportive of and directly benefiting from anything they do.&quot;<br /><br />I mustn&#39;t&#39;ve been looking in the right places to see arguments that make sense and aren&#39;t just flagrant conjecture presented as historical fact.  Got anything handy?  I&#39;m curious now.  (In looking it up I did see that it&#39;s a pretty common belief so it must have at least some credence)<br /><br />I probably sound like a troll, so I&#39;ll finish up with this:<br />We should all be able to agree that this was a retardedly irresponsible move for Hezbollah.  And that&#39;s pretty much par for the course.		</div>

They run some<br />training camps inside Iran for outside “volunteers.” Some IRGC still seem to be deployed in<br />Lebanon and actively involved in training and arming Hezbollah, other anti-Israeli groups, and<br />other elements.13 The IRGC has been responsible for major arms shipments to Hezbollah,<br />including large numbers of AT-3 anti-tank guided missiles, long-range rockets, and some<br />Iranian-made Mohajer unmanned aerial vehicles.14<br />Iran exported thousands of 122-mm rockets and Fajr-4 and Fajr-5 long-range rockets to<br />Hezbollah in Lebanon, including the Arash with a range of 21–29 kilometers. These reports give<br />the Fajr-5 a range of 75 kilometers with a payload of 200 kilograms.

Iran , which regards Hezbollah as a means of achieving its own ideological and strategic goals, is a large-scale provider of military support to Hezbollah. This includes first and foremost the al-Quds Force of Iran ’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC, hereinafter: “the Revolutionary Guards”) in Lebanon . Iran also supplies Hezbollah with a variety of military hardware, such as upgraded anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles, missile launchers, land-to-land missiles of various types, including long-range (43 km) Fajr-3 missiles and Fajr-5 missiles (with a 75 km range). Iranian assistance also comprises military training, logistic support, and financial assistance estimated at several millions of US dollars yearly (in addition to Hezbollah’s endeavors to generate its own financial resources through fundraising in Western countries and through criminal activity, mostly money counterfeiting and drug smuggling). Following recent evidence of Iranian and Hezbollah involvement in the bombing of the Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires (1994), the Argentinian prosecution served senior members of Hezbollah (including Imad Mughniyah), Iranian diplomats,and prominent Iranians (including former Iranian Information Minister Ali Fallahian) with arrest warrants to the judge in charge of the inquiry. A detailed recent report by Argentinian intelligence accuses Iran of direct involvement in the bombing, through its intelligence services and the Hezbollah organization.</div><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">“We view the Iranian regime as the vanguard and new nucleus of the leading Islamic State in the world. We abide by the orders of one single wise and just leadership, represented by “Wali Faqih” and personified by Khomeini…Whoever offends the Muslims, offends in fact the body of our Umma, and we shall therefore endeavor to stand up against this threat, guided by a legitimate ruling and an all-embracing political doctrine determined by the leader i.e., Wilayat al-Faqih.”1<br />[Excerpt from Hezbollah’s political platform, February 1985]</div><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">This view is evidenced by Iranian leader Ali Khamenei’s statement in which he explicitly called on Hezbollah to focus its activities on supporting the Palestinian struggle. Khamenei made this statement after his meetings with senior members of Hezbollah at the International Conference in Support of the Palestinian Intifada held in Tehran in April 2001. The appeal was reiterated in the closing address of the conference, which called on “all those who took part in the liberation of southern Lebanon to assist the Palestinian resistance.”</div><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Hassan Nasrallah (left) with Member of the Iranian Majlis (Parliament) Hojjat-ol-Eslam Ali Akbar Mohtashemi-Pour, one of the founders of Hezbollah, and prominent member of Hamas leadership Khaled Mash’al (right), at the Conference of Islamic Clerics in Beirut on January 6, 2002</div><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">In the course of the past few years, Hezbollah has been supplied, mainly via air shipments, with large quantities of high-quality arms, including upgraded anti-tank missiles, Katyusha rockets, anti-aircraft cannons and missiles of various ranges, SA-7 and SA-14 shoulder missiles, equipment and arms for small-scale maritime warfare, motorized gliders, and even sophisticated military hardwaresuch as long-range land-to-land missiles of types Fajr-3 (with a 43 km range) and Fajr-5 (with a 75 km range).

Following his Middle East tour briefing, the UN Security Council is considering to form a special investigation team, probing implementation of its resolution on Lebanon. Sources in New York said the secretary-general informed the Security Council that he had obtained evidence from Israel and from &quot;another country&quot; indicating that Syria and Iran were indeed smuggling arms into Lebanon.<br /><br />Those sources disclose that advanced Iranian-Chinese missiles have already been smuggled into Lebanon. Among these are allegedly Iranian Sayyad (U.S. Hawk derivative), Misagh 2 (derivative of the Russian SA-18 Igla) and Shahab Tagheb (Chinese HQ-7 derivative) air defense missiles. <br /><br />Unconfirmed reports, from sources close to IDF intelligence, indicated that this week, Hezbollah had officially formed its new air defense wing, for which several hundred graduates had just ended their training in Iran, learning how to use air defense missiles in combat. According to these reports, a group of specially selected Hezbollah trainees were flown from Damascus to Tehran early March to start a six week training session held by Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) instructors at the Imam Ali base.<br /><br />Lebanon is considered the finest example of Quds Force &quot;success&quot; and is used as the front line in the campaign against Israel . The Force operates in Lebanon through local headquarters nicknamed &quot;the Lebanese corps.&quot; Every activity undertaken by the Quds Force in Lebanon is coordinated with the Syrian regime, and Syria serves as the conduit through which weapons are shipped from Iran to Lebanon . The Quds Force gave Hezbollah massive active support during the second Lebanon war (July-August 2006) and was integrated into the organization&#39;s command structure. After the war it performed a significant role in rehabilitating Hezbollah&#39;s military might, one of whose manifestations was the smuggling of weapons from Iran to Lebanon <br />The Quds Force plays a central role in the training received by Hezbollah operatives in camps in Iran , using bases and facilities belonging to the Revolutionary Guards. The training is intended to raise the Hezbollah operatives&#39; military level and to teach them to use the modern weapons Iran provides them with. Revolutionary Guards also train Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon , especially at bases and facilities in the Beqa&#39;a Valley/. <br /><br />Hezbollah operatives undergo various types of training in Iran , from integrated maneuvers to launching anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons, including Sagger and TOW missiles. Special attention is given to training Hezbollah operatives in the use of strategic and advanced weapons, such as ground-to-ground rockets with a range of more than 75 km (46.4 miles) and unmanned planes. Revolutionary Guards officers helped Hezbollah launch an Iranian-made unmanned plane into Israel in November 2004.<br /><br />The two main camps used most often by the Quds Force for the training of foreign terrorist-operatives are the Imam Ali camp in Tehran and the camp at Bahonar near Karaj , north of Tehran. Two Hezbollah guerillas who were captured by the IDF during the second Lebanon war stated during interrogation that they had been trained by Revolutionary Guards operatives at the camp near Karaj . One of these was Hussein Ali Suleima, who was involved in the abducting of the two IDF soldiers, Eldad Regev and Ehud Goldwasser, the act which led to the outbreak of the war. Suleima stated that he had been trained in Iran by the IRGC as part of a group of 40-50 Hezbollah operatives from Lebanon. Their passports were not stamped in either Syria or Iran to hide the fact that they had undergone training in Iran.<br /><br />In Lebanon itself Hezbollah has established at least six major training bases and weapons depots, the majority located in the Bekka valley. Until the Syrian withdrawal these had been under the supervision and protection of the Syrian Army in Lebanon and run by Iranian IRGC instructors and logistical experts. According to intelligence reports (not updated after September 2006) the location of these bases are:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.heritage.org/research/middleeast/upload/wm_1815.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.heritage.org/research/middleeas...oad/wm_1815.pdf</a><br />Mugniyah was a favorite surrogate of Iran, reportedly<br />working closely with Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence<br />and Security (MOIS) and the Revolutionary<br />Guard’s elite Quds Force unit, which maintained a<br />long-term presence in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, a<br />Hezbollah stronghold. Mugniyah reportedly played<br />an important role in arranging the training of Palestinian<br />terrorists by Hezbollah and Iranian Revolutionary<br />Guards. He helped arrange the aborted 2002<br />transfer of 50 tons of Iranian arms to the Palestine<br />Liberation Organization, using the freighter Karine<br />A, which was intercepted by Israeli naval forces<br />before it could smuggle its deadly cargo into Gaza.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.rightsidenews.com/20080318531/global-terrorism/iran-and-syria-train-hamas-and-provide-rocket-technology.html" target="_blank">http://www.rightsidenews.com/20080318531/g...technology.html</a><br />(Different model 122mm Grad rockets manufactured in Russia and China were supplied to Hezbollah in Lebanon by Iran and Syria. <br /><br />Most of the rockets launched by Hezbollah at population centers in Israel during the second Lebanon war were various types of 122mm Grad rockets.)<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.technonllc.com/index.php?/archives/30-Nasrallahs-Deputy-Admits-Iranian-Control-on-Hezbollahs-Operations.html" target="_blank">http://blog.technonllc.com/index.php?/arch...Operations.html</a><br />In an interview granted to an Iranian TV channel, Sheikh Naim Qassem, Hassan Nasrallah’s deputy, stresses that Hezbollah’s policy of terrorist operations against Israel (including suicide bombings and rocket fire) requires jurisprudent permission of the Iranian leadership. <br /><br />2. During the interview, Sheikh Naim Qassem uncharacteristically admitted that Hezbollah does not pursue its own policy but rather submits to the authority of the Iranian leadership, which instructs it even on such military-operative issues as the confrontation with Israel . Such instructions are based on the ideology of the Iranian Islamic regime, set forth by Ayatollah Khomeini, whose key principle is the rule of the jurisprudent ( wilayat al-faqih ). The title used by Sheikh Naim Qassem to describe Hezbollah&#39;s source of authority is “al-wali al-faqih” (the ruling jurisprudent), a title formerly used by Ayatollah Khomeini and presently used by his successor, leader 1Ali Khamenei.<br /><br />3. In the second part of the interview granted to Al-Kawthar, Sheikh Naim Qassem described the relationship between Hezbollah and the Iranian leadership, noting that:<br /><br />a. Hezbollah was founded and commenced activities in 1982, based on a religious ruling made by Imam Khomeini, who considered jihad (holy war) against Israel to be an Islamic religious duty.<br /><br />b. Hezbollah is committed to receive religious instruction regarding the nature of the confrontation with Israel from al-wali al-faqih (the ruling jurisprudent, a title nowadays reserved exclusively for leader Khamenei). For example, Sheikh Naim Qassem had the following to say about suicide bombing attacks: “No one may kill himself without a jurisprudent permission.”<br /><br />c. Firing rockets on Israeli civilians also requires the jurisprudent permission of the Iranian leadership.<br /><br />d. Hezbollah has means to inquire (implying with the source of religious authority, Ali Khamenei) “what can or cannot be done, what is our duty and what is subject to our own consideration.”<br /><br />4. The above statements made by Sheikh Naim Qassem, Hassan Nasrallah&#39;s deputy, are yet another testimony that Hezbollah considers Iran and its leader Khamenei to be the highest source of authority of its activity and policy, including its policy of terrorist operations (even though in public statements Hezbollah often plays down the fact that its policy of terrorist attacks is set in Tehran). Based on that concept, which is unique to the Islamic revolution in Iran , Hezbollah nurtures Khamenei&#39;s personality cult among its operatives and among the Shi&#39;ite community in Lebanon , portraying the “leader” as a role model and as an example to be followed (see Appendix <img src="src" alt="image" />/cool.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid="B)" border="0" alt="cool.gif" /&gt;. It should be noted that Hezbollah seniors, namely Hassan Nasrallah in the past and Sheikh Muhammad Yazbek in the present, have been given the title of Khamenei&#39;s Islamic religious representative ( wakil shar&#39;i ) in Lebanon . 2<br /><br />*note: I had to stop quoting things at the end, grrr<br />		</div>

The craft can threaten US Sixth Fleet and Israel Navy shipping close to Lebanese shores, reach Israel’s Haifa and Ashdod Mediterranean ports and raid its coastal oil installations.<br /><br />The speedboats were tailor-made for Hizballah by Iranian Revolutionary Guards shipyards at Bandar Abbas as the only marine terror fleet operating in Mediterranean waters. Our military sources report the boats are capable of carrying chemical, biological and radiological weapons systems. <br /><br />They were delivered in mid-April by an Iranian freighter at the Syrian port of Latakia and trucked to Naimah port south of Beirut. There they were hidden in the subterranean hangars belonging to Ahmed Jibril, head of the Palestinian Liberation Front-General Command. Today, the PLF-GC is financed and directed by the Revolutionary Guards. The hangars were constructed in the seventies by East Germany engineers with a protected Mediterranean anchorage and made virtually impenetrable by sea or air.</div><br />pretty direct if you ask me		</div>

						I&#39;d like to start by saying that you&#39;ve done a great job compiling stuff to look over.  I read a bit of it, but I&#39;m at work so I don&#39;t have that much time.  I&#39;ll get to it later.<br /><br />From what I did read I wanted to say that there is a difference between the IRGC and Iran.  It&#39;s like saying that the Sinn Fein is the same as Ireland.  There probably are connections, but it falls short of the type of evidence I&#39;d like to see before we march over there to turn the country into a glass parking lot.  (not what your suggesting, I know)<br /><br />The interview with Sheikh Naim Qassam was pretty intriguing though.  I&#39;m not sure exactly what he&#39;s saying though.  It can be read one of two ways (skimmed it due to time constraints so correct me if I&#39;m wrong):<br />1. Iran endorses and supports Hezbollah<br />or<br />2. Iran neither endorses nor condemns Hezbollah, but does in fact try to keep them under control as much as possible.<br /><br />Just because Iran is asking for Hezbollah to ask for jurisprudent permission before doing some of there most questionable activities does not mean that they endorse it.  It kind of seems like they are trying to slow those kinds of things down.  However this is probably how an evil Iran would want to be seen.<br /><br />Ask someone if they are lying and you&#39;ll never know the truth...<br /><br />Using Iranian Arms does not mean they are endorse by Iran any more than the insurgents&#39; use of AK47&#39;s means they are in league with Russia.<br /><br />Altogether though it&#39;s hard to discount some kind of connection.  Thanks for all that, I&#39;ll be busy tonight I guess.<br /><br />A note from the lefty in me:<br />What does it matter if Iran and Hezbollah both want to blow Israel to kingdom come?  Israel&#39;s not a whole lot better for the region than Hezbollah.  I thought we were in this to keep America safe.  Israel has proven she can take care of herself.  And then some.		</div>

						1.  It allied with the Northern Alliance because the Taliban/AQ was/is Sunni<br />2.  It did not really detain Bin Laden&#39;s son, it put him in house arrest and allowed him to continue to make phone calls etc<br />3.  It gave out aid to the people of Lebanon to make itself look good<br /><br />And, do you think anybody should be able to buy Iranian weaponry?  Arent there international arms agreements that ban the sale of arms to certain groups?  If the US cant legally ship arms to civil war groups in Africa, then neither should those groups be able to buy Iranian weapons.  The truth is Iran can pick and choose who their customers are in terms of what is legal and not.  If there were bombmaking plants in Mexico that were being used to ship bombs over the border and kill Americans and  the Mexican government could put an end to it but didnt, then what should the US response be?  Bomb those factories out of existence?  It relates directly to Iranan IED-factories being allowed to run and ship bombs over the border to kill coalition forces.  It shouldnt be tolerated.		</div>

						<div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">McCain Defeats Romney in Florida Vote<br />By MICHAEL COOPER and MEGAN THEE<br /><br />MIAMI — Senator John McCain defeated Mitt Romney on Tuesday to win the delegate-rich Florida primary, solidifying his transformation to the Republican front-runner and dealing a devastating blow to the presidential hopes of Rudolph W. Giuliani.<br /><br />Republican officials said after Mr. Giuliani’s distant third-place finish that he was likely to endorse Mr. McCain, possibly as early as Wednesday in California. They said the two candidates’ staffs were discussing the logistics of an endorsement.<br /><br />The results were a decisive turning point in the Republican race, effectively winnowing the field to Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney, two candidates with very different backgrounds who have little affection for one another but share a similar challenge in winning over elements of the party suspicious of their ideological credentials.<br /><br />While most of the attention in Florida was on the Republicans, Democratic voters gave Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton a victory in a virtually uncontested race. The Democratic Party had stripped the state of its delegates as a punishment for moving its primary earlier in the year, and the leading candidates refrained from campaigning there.<br /><br />Mr. McCain’s victory showed he could win among Republican voters. Florida allows only registered Republicans to vote in its primary, unlike New Hampshire and South Carolina, where Mr. McCain’s victories earlier this month were fueled by independent voters.<br /><br />With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. McCain had 36 percent of the vote, Mr. Romney 31 percent, Mr. Giuliani 15 percent and Mike Huckabee 14 percent.<br /><br />“Our victory might not have reached landslide proportions,” Mr. McCain said, “but it is sweet nonetheless.”<br /><br />After a campaign in which he was often on the attack, Mr. McCain went on to praise his rivals, especially Mr. Giuliani, who he said had “invested his heart and soul in this primary, and who conducted himself with all the qualities of the exceptional American leader he truly is.”<br /><br />Mr. Romney made clear that he would go all-out in the coming week, as the presidential race builds toward its biggest day so far, a set of more than 20 contests across the country on Tuesday. He and Mr. McCain fought an increasingly bitter battle in Florida, and they now seem likely to take their messages to the national stage, with Mr. Romney trying to portray Mr. McCain as out of step with his party on critical issues and ill-equipped to deal with the economic downturn and with Mr. McCain suggesting that Mr. Romney’s principles yield too easily to the political winds and that he cannot be trusted on national security.<br /><br />The meaning of Mr. McCain’s victory starts with the trove of 57 delegates it brings him, the bounty of a winner-take-all contest and the biggest prize of the campaign to date. But it also gives him a chance to start persuading his party to put aside the deep internal divisions that have been exposed by the campaign and begin coalescing around him.<br /><br />Mr. Romney was having none of it. He continued to call for change in Washington and got in what sounded like another swipe at Mr. McCain when he said America needed a president who had “actually had a job in the real economy.”<br /><br />Surveys of voters leaving polling places painted a picture of how successful each campaign was. They found that Mr. McCain not only did significantly better than Mr. Romney among voters who listed the war as their top concern, but also did better than him with voters who said they were most concerned about the economy.<br /><br />Mr. Romney did significantly better than Mr. McCain among voters who said they were most concerned about immigration.<br /><br />Both candidates now face the challenge of rallying the fractured party establishment and grass-roots conservatives behind them — or at least not around their opponent.<br /><br />Mr. McCain, of Arizona, emerges from Florida with an opportunity to get back to where he was at the beginning of this roller-coaster of an election season: the anointed front-runner. Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor whose early goals of winning Iowa and New Hampshire were thwarted, wanted to show he could prevail in a competitive election somewhere outside his native Michigan so he could battle on in the week to come.<br /><br />But the outcome could be decisive for Mr. Giuliani, who suffered lopsided losses in all the early voting states this year and had staked his candidacy on a strong showing in Florida, where he campaigned more than anywhere else and outspent his rivals on television advertisements over the last month.<br /><br />Exit polls showed that Mr. Giuliani did not even have a clear edge among voters who were most concerned about his signature issue, terrorism; incomplete returns Tuesday night showed him narrowly finishing ahead of Mr. Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, who barely campaigned in Florida.<br /><br />Mr. Giuliani, speaking in Orlando, thanked his supporters and talked about his campaign in the past tense but did not drop out of the race. “The responsibility of leadership doesn’t end with a single campaign,” he said in a serious, gracious speech that he leavened with a humorous asides. “If you believe in a cause, it goes on and you continue to fight for it, and we will. I’m proud that we chose to stay positive and to run a campaign of ideas.”<br /><br />Surveys of voters leaving the polls found that nearly half of Republican voters listed the economy as the most important issue in exit polls, while 21 percent said terrorism, 16 percent immigration and 14 percent the war in Iraq.<br /><br />Four in 10 Republican voters said illegal immigrants working in the United States should be deported, while about 3 in 10 said they should be allowed to stay as temporary workers, and the same number said they should be offered a chance to apply for citizenship. Mr. McCain was supported by a plurality of those who favored citizenship, and Mr. Romney by those who favored deportation.<br /><br />Hispanics, who made up more than one-tenth of the Republican voters, said they were more inclined to favor a guest-worker program over deportation. Forty-three percent of them said illegal immigrants should be allowed to remain in the United States as temporary workers, while one-third said they should be offered the opportunity to apply for citizenship. Only one-fifth of Hispanic Republicans said they favored deporting illegal immigrants.<br /><br />Mr. McCain, who last spring supported the immigration proposal that would have created a guest-worker program and a path toward citizenship for illegal immigrants, won roughly half the Hispanic vote. Mr. Giuliani, who strongly courted Cuban-Americans in the Miami area, won about one-quarter of the Hispanic vote, and Mr. Romney, who took the hardest line on illegal immigration, finished a distant third.<br /><br />Mr. McCain may have been helped with some Hispanic voters by the endorsement he gained last week from Senator Mel Martinez, Republican of Florida. An even bigger surprise endorsement, by the popular Republican governor, Charlie Crist, also appeared to help him.<br /><br />More than 4 in 10 voters said Mr. Crist’s endorsement of Mr. McCain was important to them, and just over half of them voted for Mr. McCain.<br /><br />The exit poll was conducted throughout the state by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International for the National Election Pool with 1,505 Republican primary voters. To take into account the large number of early and absentee voters in Florida, Edison/Mitofsky conducted a pre-election telephone poll and included those results with the opinions of the voters exiting polls on Tuesday.<br /><br />Mr. McCain, who ran a more negative campaign than usual against Mr. Romney in the last few days, praised Mr. Romney and his supporters in his victory speech, saying, “The margin that separated us tonight surely isn’t big enough for me to brag about or for you to despair.”</div><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/us/politics/30florida.html?hp" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/us/polit...florida.html?hp</a>		</div>

In fact, it was one of the reasons I liked McCain so much in the past.  I have a problem with him ignoring that principle for the sake of his party.  He played the politics rather than developing real solutions; if it was an issue he never claimed to care so deeply about, I wouldn&#39;t care as much.  But when you run on a moral platform and then throw those very morals in the trash, you&#39;re not worth the air you&#39;re breathing.<br /><br />The immigration issue is insanely easy to comprehend, so it is terrifying that he doesn&#39;t really understand it.  He wasn&#39;t hard on illegal immigration before because he&#39;s a moderate and that is where moderates stand, but it had absolutely nothing to do with real sound judgment.  Now, as he&#39;s running for the republican nomination, he changes his very moderate views on immigration to sound conservative.  He still doesn&#39;t understand why it is an issue, he just knows that it is an issue.  Because of that, he has absolutely no clue how to approach the problem in a responsible manner.  &quot;Throw the wall up and we&#39;ll solve the rest later&quot; is irresponsible, overly costly, and careless.<br /><br />Paul is presenting a plan to entirely revamp our federal government and the horrible effects it has on our economy so that it can&#39;t fuck shit up again.  As a part of that plan, he has developed realistic ways to decrease spending to facilitate that change.  That is the only real plan to fix our economy that has been presented in decades; none of the other candidates (republican or democrat) have presented similarly long-term solutions.  Paul is an ex-economist who has been trying to push his economic policies in congress for decades.  He forsaw the recession at the end of the 80s; he forsaw the recession we&#39;re entering now; he&#39;s been trying to get congress to address the run-away-inflation that we&#39;re seeing now even when our dollar was doing fairly well under the Clinton administration.<br /><br />Obama has pretty much the same economic policies as Hillary, so I don&#39;t really support either candidate&#39;s economic stances.  As a conservative, Romney probably has a better economic approach, but he wouldn&#39;t work to curb spending overseas, so his economic approach would be harmful (just like G.W.&#39;s).  Both Romney and Hillary have economic experience outside of congress, and they have at least both developed economic strategies.  McCain&#39;s &quot;economic strategy&quot; is nothing more than &quot;we need to fix the economy, but I&#39;m not entirely sure how...we&#39;ll figure it out when we get into office though, for sure.&quot;		</div>

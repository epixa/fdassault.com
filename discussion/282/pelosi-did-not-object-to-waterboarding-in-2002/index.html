Harman was later pushed aside when Pelosi won in 2006.<br /><br />Now, I&#39;m all for the recent uprising in opposition to our use of torture techniques such as waterboarding that is being led by democrats, and I&#39;m happy that Pelosi is on-board that campaign; however, it really doesn&#39;t speak much for her that a few short years ago she did nothing to put a stop to it when she found out.  It really goes to show that no matter how you feel about the use of torture, the argument for or against it within congress seems largely political.<br /><br />I hope the campaign succeeds, but this definitely took her down another notch in my book.		</div>

						I fully support Jane Harman. She is from my district and I cannot be more happy with another candidate. She is also for medicinal marijuana. &lt;3.<br /><br />Her reply from my e-mail to her:<br />&quot;<br />     Thank you for contacting me about legislation relating to illicit<br /> narcotics.  Let me be clear, I am not in favor of the comprehensive<br /> legalization of banned substances.  <br /><br />     However, I do recognize that the health science community has<br /> found evidence that the controlled use of marijuana can provide palliative<br /> benefits to people suffering from intense pain, nausea, and loss of<br /> appetite. <br /><br />     Therefore, I support the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes<br /> if it occurs in consultation with a physician in accordance with<br /> California state law.  My voting record in Congress reflects this position.<br />  In July 2004 and June 2005, I voted in favor of amendments to the<br /> Commerce, Justice, and State Appropriations bills that supported the rights<br /> of states, such as California, to implement pre-existing state laws<br /> authorizing the use of medical marijuana.  While both amendments failed, I<br /> am hopeful that, in time, Congress will recognize the importance of<br /> this amendment and pass progressive legislation.<br /><br />      I appreciate hearing from you.  Please keep in touch.&quot;		</div>

In Mr. Valiunas&#39;s telling, it was a scene from the Inferno: &quot;Oxygen starvation and carbon monoxide poisoning killed many; bomb shelters turned into ovens and roasted the persons inside, so that rescue workers days later found the bodies seared together in an indistinguishable mass; the molten asphalt of the streets engulfed those who fled the burning buildings.&quot;<br /><br />An estimated 45,000 people died this way in Hamburg. U.S. and British air forces would repeat the procedure over Dresden, Tokyo, Yokohama, Hiroshima, Nagasaki--cities of real or at least arguable military significance. Hundreds of smaller cities and towns of doubtful strategic value were also reduced to ash and rubble, bringing the total civilian death toll to about 600,000 Germans (including 75,000 children under 14) and a roughly equal number of Japanese. How can this be justified? Does it not greatly diminish Allied claims to moral superiority?<br /><br />Most people would argue that it does not, even though the horror of what was done to Hamburg and the other cities dwarfs in moral scale the worst U.S. abuses in the war on terror (real or alleged), which are so frequently cited as evidence that we have debased ourselves beyond recognition. Most people would also agree that the only compelling ethical defense that can be made for the bombing campaign is that it hastened Allied victory, spared at least as many lives (on both sides) as it cost, and created the conditions for a more peaceful postwar world. In other words, the question here isn&#39;t about the intrinsic morality of the bombing. It&#39;s about whether the good that flowed from the bombing outweighed the unmistakable evil of the act itself.</div><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Whatever side one takes here, the important point is that the debate fundamentally is about results. Note the difference with the current debate over waterboarding, where opponents argue that the technique is unconscionable and inadmissible under any circumstances, even in hypothetical cases where the alternative to waterboarding is terrorist attacks resulting in mass casualties among innocent civilians. According to this view, it is possible to wage war yet avoid the classic &quot;choice of evils&quot; dilemmas that confronted past statesmen such as Churchill and Roosevelt. Or, to put the argument more precisely, it is possible to avoid this choice if one is also prepared to pay for it in blood--if not in one&#39;s own, than in that of kith and kin and whoever else&#39;s life must be sacrificed to keep our consciences clear.</div><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/11/exclusive-only-.html" target="_blank">http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/1...sive-only-.html</a><br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">For all the debate over waterboarding, it has been used on only three al Qaeda figures, according to current and former U.S. intelligence officials. <br /><br />As ABC News first reported in September, waterboarding has not been used since 2003 and has been specifically prohibited since Gen. Michael Hayden took over as CIA director.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">As a result of Hayden&#39;s decision, officials say, the most extreme technique left available to CIA interrogators would be what is termed &quot;longtime standing,&quot; which includes exhaustion and sleep deprivation with prisoners forced to stand handcuffed, with their feet shackled to the floor.<br /><br />The most effective use of waterboarding, according to current and former CIA officials, was in breaking Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, known as KSM, who subsequently confessed to a number of ongoing plots against the United States.<br /><br />A senior CIA official said KSM later admitted it was only because of the waterboarding that he talked. <br /><br />Ultimately, KSM took responsibility for the 9/ll attacks and virtually all other al Qaeda terror strikes, including the beheading of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.<br /><br />&quot;KSM lasted the longest under waterboarding, about a minute and a half, but once he broke, it never had to be used again,&quot; said a former CIA official familiar with KSM&#39;s case.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">6. Waterboarding (as demonstrated in the picture above): The prisoner is bound to an inclined board, feet raised and head slightly below the feet. Cellophane is wrapped over the prisoner&#39;s face and water is poured over him. Unavoidably, the gag reflex kicks in and a terrifying fear of drowning leads to almost instant pleas to bring the treatment to a halt. <br /><br />According to the sources, CIA officers who subjected themselves to the waterboarding technique lasted an average of 14 seconds before caving in.</div>		</div>

						By the way, I do agree that it is torture and my choice for President is John McCain who is against it.  When he was asked about a 1/10000000000etc chance of catching a terrorist who had knowledge of an imminent plot and whether he would rule out waterboarding, he dodged the question.

						Not sure what this has to do with much... but I think it is interesting how often there are forms of torturing on TV.  Like when batman gets a hold of some dude, he scares him into giving him information.  Same basic idea as torture.

						Torture makes people confess to shit they didn&#39;t do.  You cannot trust anything someone says when they&#39;re saying it to get you to stop torturing them.  <br /><br />How many cases have we all heard of police interrogators coercing a confession out of innocent people?  I&#39;m sure the techniques they&#39;re using aren&#39;t even half has harsh as the ones used by the CIA to interrogate terrorists, so why do you think the information they&#39;re giving could possibly be the least bit accurate?		</div>

						I read all that and does waterboarding hurt the person or is it just mental and short term torture ? Because it might be torture but if it doesn&#39;t permanently mentally change the person and it doesn&#39;t give pain to the person we can argue if it can be used or not. Although I agree with CJ, when you are tortured you can tell anything to get out of the situation so it is not accurate and the information might not be valid at all.		</div>

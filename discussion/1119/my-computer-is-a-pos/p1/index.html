						What are you planning on using it for?<br /><br />It&#39;s pretty good.  Won&#39;t be able to run Crysis at full, but can handle almost anything.<br /><br />On a side note, I have that video card (2 for SLI).  Works well... too bad I didn&#39;t realize that SLI doesn&#39;t support multiple monitors.  It&#39;s a pretty good graphics card.		</div>

I know you didn&#39;t want to spec one out yourself because you would get carried away, but if you literally go piece for piece with this machine and scrap the OS, you very well might come out a decent amount cheaper.		</div>

						I can never find cases I like. <img src="src" alt="image" />/sad.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid=":(" border="0" alt="sad.gif" /&gt;<br /><br />But the main reason is that I&#39;m not up to date with the finer points of the new technology and where the price/performance happy-area is at.

						I came up with a little something and I thought it could be legit. Got a bigger HD, better sound card, better optical drive, and bigger power supply all for &#36;589. I figured you had your own mouse and keyboard already so I didn&#39;t look them up. You save about &#36;30 and have some better shit. I&#39;m sure some other people could find better but it took me about 15 minutes to throw something together. I was a little unsure about a couple of things though. Not sure whether to go WD or Seagate on the HD nd not sure about power supply. I don&#39;t know enough about them to make good decisions so I just picked the ones that seemed the best priced.

I don&#39;t know much about computers though so people please edit my suggestions.		</div>

						I guess 7-8 years was a bit of an exaggeration but I think it could last at least 5 if not more. And this is all relative to gaming. I have a 9 year-old HP computer that my dad bought when I was in 4th grade that still works great for surfing the web, doing homework, or occasionally playing Starcraft.		</div>

But like you said, you can&#39;t really utilize surround sound, so you probably won&#39;t need it.  If you ever decide to get a decent sound system, just upgrade your sound card then.<br /><br />Coolmaster cases are designed specifically for maximum cooling, as their name would suggest.  However, if you are really concerned about heat generation, the case he found is probably not a good idea.  The design is actually pretty awesome for good airflow -- CPU heat is directed immediately out of the case, a large 120mm fan at the back of the case would suck a huge amount of air out of the back as an 80mm fan in the front would pull in cool air from outside and the two would create a good current.  The side vent would help keep the PCI cars cool as well, and if you could probably just drill some holes to turn it into another fan slow entirely.  But your old case is a full tower and you have massive amounts of cooling in it (I don&#39;t think 7 120mm fans will accomplish anything more than a good airflow design, but that&#39;s your thing).  This case is only a mid tower and obviously doesn&#39;t have anywhere close the amount of fans you&#39;re used to.  I recommend staying with coolmaster, but perhaps you could look at a large, more expensive model that would give you more airflow options.<br /><br />Power supplies aren&#39;t really that expensive, and the higher wattage you go the warmer they&#39;ll run.  If you&#39;re really concerned about heat, don&#39;t get a really high wattage power supply until you need it.		</div>

The only really good cooling thing about that cooler master case is the side air duct because it is located right where the processor is, but your processor probably won&#39;t make the most heat, your video card will.  The side fans for the antec cases are located where the video card will be located.  not to mention the number of fans that go into the case, the three hundred and nine hundred both have 5 fans as a mid tower and the twelve hundred has 7 fans as a full tower. I really do not see how you can think that cooler master case can compare to the antec case I have listed.<br /><br />I seen all of these cases in use.  I have the twelve hundred, I built a friends computer with the three hundred, and I have a friend who uses the nine hundred.  We all live in dorms where there is no A/C and it is hot as shit at the beginning of the fall semester and the end of the spring semester. These cases are terrific for cooling as you can see with all the new egg reviews.		</div>

I believe a fan on the top is a must for good cooling since heat rises that is probably the greatest place to have a fan which all the antec cases have (200mm fans except for the three hundred has a 140mm fan) and that cooler master case does not have.  The only really good cooling thing about that cooler master case is the side air duct because it is located right where the processor is, but your processor probably won&#39;t make the most heat, your video card will.  The side fans for the antec cases are located where the video card will be located.  not to mention the number of fans that go into the case, the three hundred and nine hundred both have 5 fans as a mid tower and the twelve hundred has 7 fans as a full tower. I really do not see how you can think that cooler master case can compare to the antec case I have listed.<br /><br />I seen all of these cases in use.  I have the twelve hundred, I built a friends computer with the three hundred, and I have a friend who uses the nine hundred.  We all live in dorms where there is no A/C and it is hot as shit at the beginning of the fall semester and the end of the spring semester. These cases are terrific for cooling as you can see with all the new egg reviews.</div><br /><br />You didn&#39;t post the nine hundred or the twelve hundred, so whatever their specs may be is entirely irrelevant.<br /><br />The fan on the top of the case is definitely necessary when the cooling for the rest of the case is so mediocre, as is the case with the antec 300.  In general a top fan will never hurt, but it is best to augment a case that already provides a solid air flow.<br /><br />The things that cause the most heat in the case are the hard drives, power supply, cpu, and graphics card.  By putting the power supply at the bottom of the case, you&#39;re making all of the interior heat from the power supply rise up through the entire case.  The hard drives in the front of the case will have to rely exclusively on standard vents to cool off -- a horrible solution especially if you plan to do any raid setup or simply have many hard drives.  The CPU fan is more than capable of cooling off the CPU without the help of anything else, yet it&#39;s just going to be blowing warm air into the case rather than adopting a simple tube of plastic that stops a massive amount of the heat from the CPU from ever entering the case at large.  The 120mm and 140mm fans will create cross ventilation across about 1/4 of the case.  That&#39;s hardly an efficient use of the only two fans in the case, especially given that they&#39;re so large.<br /><br />The coolmaster, on the other hand, creates a solid airflow with a large exhaust fan in the back and an 80mm in the front to push denser, cooler air over the hard drives and pull expanded, heated air out the back.  In the meantime, the warm CPU exhaust is directed immediately out of the case, and the power supply excess heat can best dissipate through the more efficient aluminum case.  The only thing that generates heat without an immediate place to release it is the graphics card, but it has two different ways of leaving the case quickly.  Cooler air from the outside is going to be pulled through the side air vent which will help cool the air around the card, and any excess heat will float up and out of the back of the case.  It&#39;s not the greatest design; I specifically told Erling that it probably wouldn&#39;t be cool enough for his needs (your antec 1200 would), but it is a much better thought out case than the antec 300 in terms of cooling.		</div>

I was basing my analysis of the antec 300 cooling on the tech specifications from newegg -- they list the case as having only a single top and a single rear fan.  The article you just posted says the antec 300 has 7 fans, which is obviously quite different.		</div>

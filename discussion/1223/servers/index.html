						I know we tried everything (including the kitchen sink) before the decision to shut down the server was made, but would anyone be up for giving it another shot?<br /><br />I&#39;ve been playing in resin a lot lately and have noticed...<br /><br />1) a lot of donuts and donut regs still play (I&#39;ve seen frat, tommy, redbone, rubix, gamms, rhyno, hex, jismify, meathammer, silent, shadoww, catwoman -- and i&#39;m sure there&#39;s more)<br /><br />2) there are people i&#39;ve never seen before who recognize the donut tag and want to know the ip to our server. These people have nothing but good things to say about their memories at FD, typical convo goes like &quot;Hey Magic, does donut still have a server?&quot; &quot;Nope, clan died, no more server.&quot; &quot;damn, that was full of good people and always a fun place to play.&quot; <br /><br />IDK, maybe I&#39;m being too optimistic about how much activity a server would get, but it seems like there would be a lot of people (old and new) that could end up in the server. I know that would mean a lot of work (time on the site, dishing out admin rights, patroling the serv, stats, trying to get traffic in the server, etc) -- I guess I&#39;m just missing the good ole days in FD.<br /><br /> <img src="src" alt="image" />/sad.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid=":(" border="0" alt="sad.gif" /&gt;		</div>

						i would not be in because i have not played since ~november and don&#39;t plan to start again. But if i may ask what problems do you have with the resin server, besides being able to run it as you see fit. In my opinion their rules are fair and complement an agressive and competitive style of play, and their admins are capable. 2) it would be difficult to rebuild a regular-base for an outdated game especially given the increased popularity of source and the fact that there are no new players on 1.6, just existing players who grew up on it. just look at meathammer&#39;s clan&#39;s servers. c) no scrilla to spare in this recession.

						I&#39;m kind of happy just perma wearing my donut tag in honour of how freeking awesome this place was.<br /><br />As much as I wish it was still around, I can&#39;t see it coming back. A lot of us regulars have grown up too, a lot of ppl have tough time commitments and what not, I cant see anyone being able to sacrifice the time to not only bring it back, but maintain it and help it grow.<br /><br />I&#39;m happy just bumping into old faces in resin or following them on steam friends. If people werent so fucking gay with steam names and just kept theirs the same I&#39;m sure I&#39;d remember whos who a lot more (that&#39;s a comment on general steam retards, not necessarily any people here). <br /><br /><br />Plus some of you tools who don&#39;t play anymore should give it a go when some of us are together in resin. You really will love it after being away for a while. I noes I did. I&#39;m sure soon I&#39;ll be afk a bit again for a month or two game time wise but will always come back&#33;<br /><br />&lt;3 all.		</div>

I&#39;m still going to keep the server idea in the back of my head -- if enough people show interest who know what can happen.</div><br /><br />I haven&#39;t played CS in basically forever, but I do miss the donut server days...was a lot of fun.<br /><br />I agree that a new server would probably have a following when it started but would quickly die.<br /><br />I&#39;ll try and get on and play a bit on this resin server...though i&#39;ll suck		</div>

						I wanted to do a couple things:<br /><br />-gauge interest<br />-provide a place for others to discuss (I don&#39;t think the resin server is an appropriate place to talk about the old donut server or the possibilities of a new one)<br />-put the thought in the back of people&#39;s heads and/or attempt to show that the level of former donut activity is still pretty strong<br /><br />As far as the server itself, I would possibly be able to throw a good chunk of cash into running it for the first couple months, but would also need help (I don&#39;t make THAT much, especially since I&#39;m trying to purchase a house sometime this year). But I&#39;m not the most knowledgeable when it comes to the other aspects, and would also need assistance in other areas such as:<br /><br />-maintaining / policing the server (I may play in resin a lot now, but in a few weeks my job is going to require me to be on the road a lot)<br />-any sort of forum setup / maintenance / etc<br />-advertising / finding people to play on it<br /><br />In the past I think starting a CS server was like rolling a giant stone downhill, with a large population of players it was a lot easier to start something like this up (not that it was cake, but certainly easier then it would be now). Now-a-days I feel like getting a server rolling would be equivalent to trying to roll a huge stone up a hill because of the shrinking population. I can&#39;t do it alone, but with the right amount and group of people I wouldn&#39;t say it couldn&#39;t be done.		</div>

						The problem with CS though isn&#39;t that it is &quot;dead&quot; in the traditional sense, but it is &quot;dead&quot; in the sense of growth.  There aren&#39;t new players in the game anymore.  FD&#39;s philosophy that there should be very little interference in the gameplay was not friendly to the average person joining the game for the first time, but there were enough new people joining the game that we were able to snag all of the people who had a similar philosophy and keep them hooked.<br /><br />IP changes and over-confidence in the leadership certainly didn&#39;t help, but I believe the biggest problem was definitely the decline in new players to take the place of the retiring regulars over time.		</div>

						i hear ya bout overconfidence. they gimme hell over there, keeps me humble lol.<br />there are still about 20 thousand servers right? our assault stays full not only because of our time alive but also in part to our admins and structure, leadership and attitude. you guys arent that different. <br />we cant control who logs on. we can control jerks and makin sure those that are here in cs have a good time in server though. dont sweat the intangibles. we dont do this in resin but other clans ive set up or whatever sometimes have weekly, or bi-monthly steam chats or whatever just to keep the crew on the same page, maleable and meshed together. you guys still have your vent channel? think of resources in any shape they come in. dunno.		</div>

						As much as I&#39;d love for it to happen, I can&#39;t see the donut we all knew and loved coming back.<br /><br />The two main reason for this have already been stated, no new plays and the donut method of as little in game interference as possible.<br /><br />It isn&#39;t easy to draw players into an assault game with that mentality in the first place, but with no new players coming on line it would be almost impossible. Furthermore whilst the core community may remain in spirit on these forums, the in game donut community will not only be significantly smaller, it will be striving to try and recapture the community we once had, something which I see as almost impossible. <br /><br />I&#39;d love to be proven wrong, and would happily chip in some money when I can if you do get something running, I just think trying to re start a donut server because you miss the old days is a fundamental flaw. Those days are done, they were great while they lasted, but we are all different people now, life happens and as it&#39;s been said, this game just isn&#39;t going anywhere.		</div>

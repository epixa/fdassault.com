						Question:  Do you think the government has any role in promoting fundamental values?<br /><br />For example, should the government promote an entrepreneurial spirit as an important value or should it just create a chance for equal opportunities so that if society considers it important then it will thrive?  (By creating equal access the implicit value is that each person can pursue their happiness, but it is not explicit/a requirement to follow).<br /><br />I ask this because I think it has changed my opinion on gay marriage.  My original position was that gay couples should be given equal rights to married couples (in terms of benefits and having civil unions), but that they shouldn&#39;t be able have a state-sanctioned &quot;marriage.&quot;  My rationale was that government should be able to promote traditional marriage and the nuclear family as the fundamental building blocks of society.  But wouldn&#39;t our Founders have trusted religion/society/culture to continue viewing traditional marriage as special instead of having our government treat it as special?<br /><br />If the government is giving equal rights to gay couples except for the word &quot;marriage&quot; then the only purpose seems to be to promote traditional marriage.  [In the past the government actually gave married couples more rights than gay couples and so it was actually doing something rather than just promoting an idea, even though I am not advocating going back to that].<br /><br />It would be a totally different story if gay rights activists were trying to get religions to endorse their marriages, though.		</div>

						By asking the question as it is you&#39;re suggesting that being gay is somehow in direct opposition to &quot;fundamental values&quot;, and I therefore refuse to answer your question because doing so would help encourage your outdated views on &quot;value&quot;.<br /><br />		</div>

						As my beliefs dictate, homosexuality is wrong. However, so are a lot of things that are not illegal. I do not condone homosexuality or a homosexual lifestyle, but if a gay couple want to get married and have the same benefits as a man and woman being married, then they should be allowed to. The state should not deny them the same rights that a straight married couple get. <br /><br />To put it simply, homosexual couples should be allowed to enter the contract of marriage just like straight couples.		</div>

They would probably say something like, &quot;I just want my kid to be happy.  To meet somebody they love that they can spend their life with and raise a family with.&quot;  That doesn&#39;t have to mean the nuclear family but it points in that direction.</div><br />Not be snarky, but I think anyone would want their kid to be happy, gay or straight. I don&#39;t see how your statement points to a nuclear family; in fact, I think it doesn&#39;t point to anyone. <br /><br />Ultimately, it should not up to the state to decide who can and cannot marry who. However, in a perfect world, our government is run by the people, for the people, and if they (the people) want to elect representatives that think homosexuality should be made a crime punishable by death, there are ways to do that. On the flip side, if they want to make heterosexual marriages illegal and punishable by death, they can do that too. Furthermore, if anyone finds those hypothetical laws unfair or improper, there are ways of reversing those laws.<br /><br />Bottom line, if the people want homosexual marriages to be equal to heterosexual marriages, then they should support politicians who agree with that.		</div>

It wasn&#39;t really until Christianity entered into those areas and became able to exert significant social pressures that those behaviors became completely unwelcome. Negative views of sodomy in particular was something that seemed to be largely unique to Judeo-Christian belief systems.

Like being baptized.<br /><br />Cause basically the situation you are describing is what we see today.  Government has to STEP IN to make it illegal to discriminate against homosexuals.  That is what the federal government it for, when it comes to domestic policy.  State X,Y, or Z legalizes lynchings?  Federal Government overrules it.<br />Amendments to the Civil Rights Act of 1964<br />Add the word &quot;sexuality&quot; after &quot;sex&quot; and before &quot;national origin&quot; in all instances thereof.<br />Add the words &quot;or institution&quot; after &quot;facilities&quot; in Title III thereof.<br /><br />Decouple marriage from the legality of the union.  Marriage doesn&#39;t even generate a piece of paper, just makes you give each other rings.<br /><br />Move all rights and privileges associated with &quot;marriage&quot; to civil unions, as they are not already there.<br /><br />This isn&#39;t hard.  It doesn&#39;t require some drastic rethinking of the way we do things in this country.  And it&#39;s absolutely mindboggling that we can&#39;t get our shit together on basic human rights and dignity.  But step 1 isn&#39;t to make sure government acknowledges &quot;marriage as a religious institution.&quot; it&#39;s &quot;as a religious institution, marriage is not legally recognized by any governmental entity in the United States of America or that of any of her states.&quot;<br /><br />I don&#39;t get some kind of special tax privileges because I was baptized.<br />		</div>

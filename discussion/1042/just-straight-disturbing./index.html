IN HARLEM.  <br /><br />What IS scary is that the VP CANDIDATE didn&#39;t know what a VP does (I still don&#39;t think she gets it), that the PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE seems to be confused all the time, and there&#39;s still almost half of the country cheering him on.  The video I sent is a video of a guy walking around a McCain rally asking why they want McCain to be president.  They don&#39;t even talk about McCain once, they just say that they can&#39;t vote for a negro, that he&#39;s a muslim, that he&#39;s a terrorist, that he&#39;s a communist, that he&#39;s a socialist.<br /><br />So one side has people who are easily tricked by tricky questions.<br />The other side has a bunch of ignorant fucks.<br /><br />But continue to be scared and disturbed if it helps you sleep.<br />Practice it now and it won&#39;t feel so awkward in January: &quot;President Obama&quot;		</div>

You get the same for McCain, people only voting because he&#39;s a good Christian or he&#39;s white.  Both sides of the fence have more then enough people who couldn&#39;t name an issue if they had to, and are only voting for superficial reasons.  Despite how we disagree on just abut every issue, Andrew, at least you are voting for the issues and not just appearances like so many of the people out there.  90% of the people &#39;ve met voting for Obama can&#39;t give me a good reason for doing so.  I could probably say the same for McCain voters, but I meet so few it&#39;s hard to say accurately.		</div>

						I don&#39;t plan on watching any of Howard Sterns videos.  The man is a blight on society.  <br /><br />And you&#39;re right, there is a HUGE difference between not being able to talk intelligently about the issues, and being a hateful and willfully ignorant fuckhead.  However, there are people voting for Obama because they hate white people just as there are people voting McCain because they hate blacks.  Racism covers every walk of life.  Again, there are stupid and ignorant people on both sides of the election.<br />		</div>

Literally, if she felt the VP had the RIGHT to tell the Senate what to do on policy issues, then she was wrong.  But if she was only explaining what she hoped to do, I don&#39;t see what is wrong with what she said.  So she wants to go out and stump for issues before the Senate with the hopes of swaying policy....she does have such a right.  Can she literally sit in on Senate committee meetings and vote on things?  No, but she can have private meetings with Senators and express her opinion to them if they are willing to meet with her.<br /><br />Here is an interesting bit of information:<br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Vice_President.htm#2" target="_blank">http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/histor...President.htm#2</a><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Several framers ultimately refused to sign the Constitution, in part because they viewed the vice president&#39;s legislative role as a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. Elbridge Gerry, who would later serve as vice president, declared that the framers &quot;might as well put the President himself as head of the legislature.&quot; Others thought the office unnecessary but agreed with Connecticut delegate Roger Sherman that &quot;if the vice-President were not to be President of the Senate, he would be without employment, and some member [of the Senate, acting as presiding officer] must be deprived of his vote.&quot;<br /><br /><b>Under the original code of Senate rules</b>, the presiding officer exercised great power over the conduct of the body&#39;s proceedings. Rule XVI provided that <b>&quot;every question of order shall be decided by the President [of the Senate], without debate; but if there be a doubt in his mind, he may call for a sense of the Senate.&quot; Thus, contrary to later practice, the presiding officer was the sole judge of proper procedure and his rulings could not be turned aside by the full Senate without his assent.</b><br /><br />The first two vice presidents, Adams and Jefferson, did much to shape the nature of the office, setting precedents that were followed by others. During most of the nineteenth century, <b>the degree of influence and the role played within the Senate depended chiefly on the personality and inclinations of the individual involved.</b></div><br />		</div>

						I really can&#39;t crack your protective shell of double think can I?  <br /><br />If Obama says something it&#39;s immediately parced looking for things that can be quoted and spun to make him look like X*.

And your reason is that if you make an assumption and don&#39;t take her literally... then she&#39;s technically right&#33;  While Obama would &quot;have such a right&quot; to do everything he wants to do, but that makes him dangerous.

He thinks about what he says.  When he says the words redistributive change, he&#39;s talking about socialism, regardless of the context.&quot;<br />&quot;Palin is smart.  She makes mistakes when she talks.  When she says she would &quot;really get in there with the senators and make a lot of good policy changes that will make life better for Brandon and his family and his classroom.&quot; she is demonstrating a safe and legitimate understanding of her role as Vice President.&quot;<br /><br />The form of this particular logical fallacy is as follows:<br />X is A because Z<br />Y is not A because Z<br /><br />there are some other forms it may appear in as well.  Doublethink is a problem because it promotes *gasp* partisan decision making...  so if you fear you do it regularly, and you choose to not examine your analyses of situations for example of this logical fallacy then you are being actively ignorant, and should be mostly ignored.		</div>

Obviously I may have bias against the candidates, but I believe they&#39;re at least equally awful.<br /><br />So with that out of the way, Sarah Palin is by far the dumbest out of the four politicians on center stage.

						Double think requires that you use the same reasoning to come to two different conclusions based on the subject you wish to apply the conclusion to.  This thread is an example.<br /><br />It&#39;s &quot;just straight disturbing&quot; for people to find Obama supporters who are stupid.<br />When equally (IMO they are worse) retarded people are shown to be on the other side, suddenly it&#39;s &quot;oh well there&#39;s stupid on both sides&quot;<br /><br />You&#39;ve actually impressed me lately now that I&#39;ve spent time on meathammer&#39;s forum and subsequently got banned (apparently?)

This is just a total &quot;fuck you&quot; to intelligence.</div><br /><br />Donno if I&#39;d have bought it.  The thing is, there have been numerous underreported videos of idiotic or downright offensive McCain supporters.  There have been relatively few instances such as this, and this one was manufactured.  By posting this one and nothing else you&#39;re already demonstrating teh spin-inating.  Not that that&#39;s especially bad.  People are going to see the world through whatever eyes they happen to have.  But for all my (blatant) bias, I haven&#39;t picked up on the talking points a day after the fact to paint a narrative.  If I did, you&#39;d all be much more annoyed with me than you already are.  You&#39;re a rational guy though, so I *know* you *know* that this goes on on both sides, but if that were the narrative you truly wished to deliver I doubt this would have been how you&#39;d go about it.  You&#39;re smarter than that.<br /><br />If I were going to say our congress is corrupt I wouldn&#39;t just bring up Ted Stevens.  I&#39;d also bring up Nancy Pelosi funneling money to relatives for personal contracts.  Picking one or another side as an example invites criticism such as this.<br /><br />All that aside, you&#39;ve got a great point.  The electorate is mostly retarded.  The MSM is probably a major culprit, but I think that all this playing the refs nonsense as a way to create a false dichotomy is the primary cause of the problems with our media.  Historically speaking, both sides have played that game, whining about bias, bitching about unequal coverage, etc, though lately the R&#39;s have gotten really vocal and pissy about the liberal media.  The simple fact of the matter is this:<br /><br />If you give equal time to all points of view, regardless of merit, you aren&#39;t educating people but rather confusing the living shit out of them.  &quot;According to scientific studies, the sky is blue, water is wet, and cats don&#39;t get along with dogs.  Here to present another perspective is some dick with a PhD in psychology who has never been affiliated with a scientific study in his entire career, please help me welcome... Doctor Whoujamamma.&quot;  Just because there IS another opinion doesn&#39;t mean that we need to hear it.  It could just be well... wrong.  By setting up this worldview that no facts are stationary, that there&#39;s always a dissenting opinion, and that simply by dissenting the status-quo your opinion is granted equal merit promotes ignorance.<br /><br />A better example is the global warming thing.  For decades, most scientists in the field have been clamoring about our contribution to the problem.  As we&#39;ve pumped shit into the air, the concentrations have become higher than they&#39;ve been in all of human history.  When these concentrations are high enough (see mercury) the planet gets hotter than it would otherwise.  A small increase can have huge consequences.  Then groups arrive on the scene to say, &quot;that&#39;s just a theory, you don&#39;t KNOW we&#39;re the cause.&quot;  And they are treated as equally well informed.  Our &quot;journalists&quot; need to start practicing &quot;journalism&quot; and not act like a bulletin board for retarded ideas.  I think that might lead some of our electorate out from their rocks of ignorance.		</div>

So you think there&#39;s some evidence to support the idea that she learned... something... while governor that she didn&#39;t have a grasp of as mayor?  Because if you contend that she would learn enough from her experiences as VP to prepare her for the Presidency, I&#39;d love to feel more confident in her ability to learn at all.<br /><br />Sarah Palin represents everything that is wrong with American Democracy.  Equal credence given to ignorance as intelligence.  The dumbing down of the electorate.  Single issue voting.  Divisive politics.  Corruption.  Nepotism.  Greed.  I&#39;m not sure what there is about her that makes her appealing to anybody as a politician.  Sure, she&#39;s homey and folksy and gosh darn it she has her finger on the pulse of &quot;real america&quot;, but she shouldn&#39;t even have been elected Mayor, and the only reason she&#39;s been able to rise this far is because of her beauty queen status and a REALLY stupid electorate.<br />		</div>

						What exact &quot;experience&quot; do you both require from a president?  I hear the republicans trash Obama for his lack of &quot;experience&quot; while the democrats trash Palin for her lack of &quot;experience&quot;, but no one actually talks about what they qualify as &quot;enough&quot; experience or even what the hell they exactly think is necessary &quot;experience&quot; to be president.<br /><br />Being president requires someone to be able to handle great deals of pressure 24/7/1461, but I don&#39;t really know what type of experience you expect someone to have in order to meet that qualification.  Single mothers have to deal with great deals of pressure for more than 4 times longer than the President of the United States, so should we assume all single mothers are qualified to be president?		</div>

So you think there&#39;s some evidence to support the idea that she learned... something... while governor that she didn&#39;t have a grasp of as mayor?

Equal credence given to ignorance as intelligence.  <b>The dumbing down of the electorate.  Single issue voting.  Divisive politics.  Corruption.  Nepotism.  Greed. </b> I&#39;m not sure what there is about her that makes her appealing to anybody as a politician.  Sure, she&#39;s homey and folksy and gosh darn it she has her finger on the pulse of &quot;real america&quot;, but she shouldn&#39;t even have been elected Mayor, and the only reason she&#39;s been able to rise this far is because of her beauty queen status and a REALLY stupid electorate.</div><br /><br />Wow you really, really, really don&#39;t like this woman.<br />		</div>

While publicly supporting Palin, McCain&#39;s top advisers privately fumed at what they regarded as her outrageous profligacy. One senior aide said that Nicolle Wallace had told Palin to buy three suits for the convention and hire a stylist. But instead, the vice presidential nominee began buying for herself and her family&#8212;clothes and accessories from top stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus. According to two knowledgeable sources, a vast majority of the clothes were bought by a wealthy donor, who was shocked when he got the bill. Palin also used low-level staffers to buy some of the clothes on their credit cards. The McCain campaign found out last week when the aides sought reimbursement. One aide estimated that she spent &quot;tens of thousands&quot; more than the reported &#36;150,000, and that &#36;20,000 to &#36;40,000 went to buy clothes for her husband. Some articles of clothing have apparently been lost. An angry aide characterized the shopping spree as &quot;Wasilla hillbillies looting Neiman Marcus from coast to coast,&quot; and said the truth will eventually come out when the Republican Party audits its books.</div><br /><br />That gets followed up by a Palin aide saying, no that didn&#39;t happen, not true, neener-neener.<br /><br />By the way that article is actually really awesome.		</div>

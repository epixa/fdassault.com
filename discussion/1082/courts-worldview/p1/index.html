						I want to dig into your beliefs of not meddling in others affairs.  You are able to explain your ideals very eloquently, but I want to try to poke holes in them.<br /><br />At what point is it okay for America to intervene in others&#39; affairs?<br /><br />At what point should we have intervened in WWII, if at all?  Wouldn&#39;t early intervention urging other nations to confront Hitler earlier have saved us the greater cost of intervention later on?  What do you honestly think would have happened barring our intervention?  Were we simply too powerful for Hitler to confront even if he controlled all of Europe?<br /><br />At what point do other nations&#39; actions become so heinous that your moral duty demands you intervene?  If Canada started killing all of its potsmokers by hanging and the images were broadcast on American TV every night, wouldn&#39;t it weigh on Americans&#39; consciences as we are Canada&#39;s neighbor and we would be able to help?<br /><br />I know that is a lame example, but there are plenty of situations that can arise that challenge your worldview and force you to act differently in certain circumstances as they can be seen as exceptions to the rule.  Would you be willing to make exceptions to your rules?		</div>

						Afghanistan was necessary for retaliation to show we still have fight in us.<br />Iraq and Darfur are optional places to send our troops as we could do good in both places.  We should probably never get involved in optional wars, but if we do they need to have a broader purpose and we need to have the resources required to put forth our full effort in winning.  Vietnam was optional but it had the broader goal of stopping the spread of socialism.  However, we probably shouldn&#39;t have entered the war based on how many troops and money we shouldve expected the war effort to need.  Iraq is very similar.  It was optional but it fits into the broader goal of transforming radical Islam.  And you can say we shouldn&#39;t have entered due to not being able to bear the cost that we should have expected.  However, I can say it might be worth the cost and certainly that it is worth the cost now because victory is so near.

						I&#39;d be conflicted about the WWII question, but I know I&#39;d go to war after Pearl Harbor.  With that said, there is a large difference between going to war with a country that actually has a military, is using it, and does pose a threat to our country.<br /><br />Before you throw the 9/11 situation at me, going after Bin Laden is fine.  Invading Iraq, why?  Even if they had nuclear weapons, how were they going to attack us?  Mail it to the US with a tag that says &quot;don&#39;t open until Christmas&quot;?  I still don&#39;t understand the police the world aspect of our policies.  Most other countries hate it (I think Israel appreciates it, at least...).  It costs us a ton of money (trillions of dollars that we don&#39;t have).<br /><br />Policing the world seems to be just an excuse to me, anyway.  If our intention was to simply spread democracy and improve the well-being of others, why aren&#39;t we doing more for Rwanda?		</div>

						The problem with World War II is that it shouldn&#39;t have happened at all.  World War I was a European issue that centered around European conflicts that had began centuries before.  Had it remained as such, the outcome would have been dramatically different.  But even still, for the sake of discussion, our entry into World War II was exactly when it should have been.  Japan started the war with us, and we handily finished it.  Germany and Italy just happened to be an obstacle in the way of the defeat of Japan.<br /><br />I would have supported no earlier intervention.  Once again though, for the sake of discussion, let&#39;s assume Japan never attacked us and we didn&#39;t enter the war.  Had Germany managed to completely conquer Russia (haaaaaaaaaaaaa), France, and Britain, I assure you they would have had plenty of their own problems to deal with.  Conquering the world gets progressively more difficult, and the pursuit of it has always led to the crumbling of the empire from within, and Germany would have been no different.  Heck, there was already evidence of internal conflict even amongst Hitler&#39;s closest advisers even before the end of the war.<br /><br />If Canada started hanging people in the streets and it weighed on the conscience of Americans, then there is nothing stopping those Americans from taking up arms (well, aside from all of the stupid-ass gun control laws this country illegally imposes on its citizens) and heading into Canada to protect whomever they deem necessary.  But that&#39;s their choice, and it shouldn&#39;t be forced upon the rest of the country.<br /><br />My ideal is pretty simple: everyone deserves to be free.  In my opinion, the federal government doesn&#39;t exist for any other purpose than to preserve that freedom.  Freedom is the only thing that ensures that both life and happiness are in the hands of the individual instead of in the hands of society or the government (or worse yet, some other society or government).  So, if free men want to stand up and fight against injustice, they should.  However, the second their fight boils over into forcing a single individual to support their cause (either through manpower or property) against their will, then the fight itself is just as if not more unjust than the thing they&#39;re fighting against.<br /><br />I don&#39;t value freedom because it falls within the ideals that I preach, I have the ideals that I preach because I value freedom more than all else.<br /><br />And to clarify, I do not support having troops in any country on the planet right now.  If it were up to me, every last soldier would be in the United States tomorrow.		</div>

						Alright, that does make a lot of sense.  Two more things though:<br />1. Does it matter to you that earlier intervention in WWII could have saved us money? -probably not if you value freedom above all else, but can&#39;t freedom be negatively impacted if our country loses money and cant defend itself?<br />2. What if singular citizens going into Canada couldn&#39;t make a dent in the problem while a concerted effort by our government certainly could and 80% of Americans wanted the government to do something?		</div>

Two more things though:<br />1. Does it matter to you that earlier intervention in WWII could have saved us money? -probably not if you value freedom above all else, but can&#39;t freedom be negatively impacted if our country loses money and cant defend itself?<br />2. What if singular citizens going into Canada couldn&#39;t make a dent in the problem while a concerted effort by our government certainly could and 80% of Americans wanted the government to do something?</div><br /><br />1.  As you guessed it, no that doesn&#39;t matter to me.  As for not being able to defend ourselves, I think that&#39;s a pretty dramatic stretch in the case of WWII.  Regardless though, if a situation did arise, I don&#39;t hold the fate of the country over the ideals it was founded on.  Afterall, what makes this country different than all of the others if we give up on the principles that define us?<br /><br />2.  This type of sentiment only exists because we&#39;ve removed the value of individuals in our political system and handed all power that we have to hands of a few.  We didn&#39;t even have a federal government when ordinary people organized together to create an army to defend our independence.  If this was a nation that was truly governed by the people again, when 80% of Americans wanted to do something, it wouldn&#39;t take an executive order to make it happen.<br /><br />However, there is a huge difference between wanting something done and wanting to do something.  We&#39;ve separated the government so much from the people that when 80% of America says they want the government to do something, they don&#39;t understand that that means <i>they</i> must do something.  It&#39;s hardly the same thing, and it&#39;s the fundamental reason why we do all the stupid shit we do.<br /><br />It shouldn&#39;t be that 80% of Americans turn to the government to solve a problem.  That&#39;s so anti-republic it makes my head hurt.  It should be that 80% of America wants to solve a problem, so they use the government to organize their efforts.		</div>

						Wait, so you&#39;re saying that our armed citizens should go into another country and attempt to force change there illegally?  How could the US even consider condoning that?  Imagine if another country&#39;s citizens attempted to do that here.  Sending armed citizens into another country would likely start with a country requesting that we prevent that from happening, and likely end with military action if we refused or sat by and did nothing.  Like it or not, citizens are essentially a country&#39;s property and therefore responsibility.  Failure for a country to control their citizens in a situation like that can be construed as an act of war.		</div>

						Another thought.  Back the WWII and Japan attacking us.  Say we have irrefutable proof that Japan is hitting Pearl Harbor in 3 days (Never mind the fact that we may actually have had the knowledge and failed to take advantage of it).  We have the option of meeting them head on, fighting the battle and preventing that attack.  Do we do it?  Do we use the option of a preemptive attack to engage the Japanese Navy before they attack Pearl?  I mean, they haven&#39;t actually done anything aggressive yet.

The United States was not founded to support that, either.  Quite the opposite: the people own their country.

I don&#39;t foresee our country falling apart if my ideals were followed, so that seems like a bit of a moot point.  The only way I see our country falling apart is by continuing the path we&#39;re on.  That&#39;s kind of the point.  I&#39;m not sure what chaos you&#39;re referring to.<br /><br />To your second point, since the revolutionary war, there has never been a time when 80% of America wanted to do anything.  I think you&#39;re still confusing popularity rating with what people want to do.  The popularity of an idea is a measure of what people want done, not of what they want to do.  The problems I have with this country arise from this very gross misconception.<br /><br />However, let&#39;s <i>assume</i> the situation arose.  If 80% of the country wanted to defend the Canadians from their own government, then 80% of the population is more than welcome to do so.  If I&#39;m among the 20% that could care less, then it would be unjust for me to be forced to support it.  This is, of course, an extreme simplification of the principle since it doesn&#39;t consider state-level practices and laws, but in a very basic sense this describes the ideal.<br /><br />I don&#39;t see why Americans would have to fall way down on the scale of progress.  I&#39;m under the impression that people are inherent innovators, so I don&#39;t see how giving them more freedom will stifle that at all.		</div>

I don&#39;t foresee our country falling apart if my ideals were followed, so that seems like a bit of a moot point.  The only way I see our country falling apart is by continuing the path we&#39;re on.  That&#39;s kind of the point.  I&#39;m not sure what chaos you&#39;re referring to.<br /><br />To your second point, since the revolutionary war, there has never been a time when 80% of America wanted to do anything.  I think you&#39;re still confusing popularity rating with what people want to do.  The popularity of an idea is a measure of what people want done, not of what they want to do.  The problems I have with this country arise from this very gross misconception.<br /><br />However, let&#39;s <i>assume</i> the situation arose.  If 80% of the country wanted to defend the Canadians from their own government, then 80% of the population is more than welcome to do so.  If I&#39;m among the 20% that could care less, then it would be unjust for me to be forced to support it.  This is, of course, an extreme simplification of the principle since it doesn&#39;t consider state-level practices and laws, but in a very basic sense this describes the ideal.<br /><br />I don&#39;t see why Americans would have to fall way down on the scale of progress.  I&#39;m under the impression that people are inherent innovators, so I don&#39;t see how giving them more freedom will stifle that at all.</div><br />I think you misinterpreted my first point.  I do agree that our country will eventually fall apart if we continue down our current path.  Only then will we realize that we allowed the national govt to overstep its bounds under the Constitution and that we should have been living under a system closer to your ideals.  Yet we still follow your ideals closer than most other countries.  So the question is if you want to preserve America as it is now with its flawed ideals and work within the system to move back toward your true ideals or if you want to push for your ideals at all costs?  If the second, I think it will only occur once we continue down our current path and lose money and power and freedom = our country has to fall apart to such a degree as to wake people up.  Bad shit could happen to our country while we are in that weak position learning how to go back to our old ideals.  Thus, do you want to live in our country while shit is hitting the fan and try to push forward your ideals or would you rather keep your current lifestyle and move somewhere more stable?<br /><br />Can you explain more about the misconception between popularity of wanting an idea to get done and actually wanting to do the idea?  <br /><br />Ok, you live in Penn on the border of NY.  Right over the border there are tons of thugs beating up people for fun.  They even cross over into your town to do it too but then go back home.  Their home town in NY cant solve the problem.  Your home town can.  80% of people in your town want to stop the problem using your town&#39;s resources.  You are one of the 20% who doesnt want your town spending its resources on that.  Your town goes ahead and fixes the problem, is this unjust to you?<br /><br />Last I agree that more freedom = more innovation.  But I think our country is on a downward slope and that we won&#39;t realize that we need to go back to the more freedom end of the spectrum until we are in chaos mode.  Thus, yes we fall down on the scale of progress, but once freedom ideal is reinstituted we work back up.		</div>

Thus, yes we fall down on the scale of progress, but once freedom ideal is reinstituted we work back up.</div><br /><br />See, the problem is, my ideal doesn&#39;t work half-way.  It&#39;s actually quite detrimental to society when you&#39;re only following bits of it.  The greatest example of this is our capitalist market -- it is so ass-backwards, corrupt, and bothersome to society it almost makes your head spin, and it exists in that state because we like to think we have a &quot;free&quot; market, and when someone says otherwise, we say we have the &quot;free-est&quot; market as if that somehow makes it all better.  People are and always will be self-interested, so when you give them even the slightest bit more power than everyone else, they will exploit it to their own advantage (and most everyone else&#39;s disadvantage).<br /><br />The only way things will get better is by educating the public.  If enough of the public hear about the real problems we face as a nation, then when shit really gets bad enough that a change can take place, that change will have the support of enough people to actually happen.  So I will help to do that for as long as I have to, and I&#39;m not willing to sell out that pursuit so that I can still go to the microbrewery once a week.<br /><br />Want something done and wanting to do something are two dramatically different things.  For example, many people want to exercise and eat healthy, but that doesn&#39;t mean that anywhere close to that amount of people actually do it.  Many people want universal healthcare, but very few of them are willing to pay for it.  Many people want to spread democracy to Iraq, but very few are willing to literally write the checks to support it or put their lives on the line to make it happen.  When we measure the popularity of ideas in the US, we&#39;re not measuring the actual amount of support we have to make those ideas happen, we&#39;re measuring how the amount of people that <i>want</i> it to happen.  Unfortunately, we&#39;ve twisted our republic into a democracy, so popularity is all that fucking matters anymore.<br /><br />I&#39;m totally fine with my town getting together and doing something to stop whatever the hell they want to stop from happening.  The only catch is, they&#39;re not allowed to use my property (which includes money) to do it.  And if my town was going to force me to pay for it, luckily, towns provide natural competition for each other, so I can simply move to another.  Not so when working on an international scale where competition among an equal populous doesn&#39;t exist.		</div>

I think our founding fathers were pretty pragmatic.  I recently watched the HBO series on John Adams (highly recommended) and he didn&#39;t agree with slavery.  He thought the very principles outlined in the Declaration made it wrong, but he was pragmatic in not bringing up the issue to the southern states as it would alienate them from listening to him when he was asking them to fight.  Also, at one of the continental congresses he was asking for them to create an army or navy, but a lot of the states disagreed as it would show we were not willing to get along with the British while solutions were still possible.  So Adams stopped being mad at those states for not believing in total freedom as being necessary and proposed that George Washington (from one of those states, VA) should come up to command the Massachusetts militia and got everyone to agree on it.  Soon this meant VA was tied to the fight and saw the necessity and the next continental congresses saw fit to designate the force as the national army and to send money, supplies, and troops to it.  However, he did still get his ideals as articulated to be in the Constitution and Bill of Rights and Declaration of Ind so that slavery could be delegitimized later on in accordance with his ideals.  Maybe this just means he was pragmatic in pushing for his ideals and that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean he compromised on them.<br /><br />And Aussie Witch- I try my best.  I can&#39;t automatically be able to make clearer arguments but I will work toward it.		</div>

Our current economic predicament was, in large part, caused by problems created by excessive debt.  As part of our recovery, we have to return to the path of fiscal responsibility and renew a call for a balanced budget. <br /><br /><b>A Real Stimulus for Our Economy: Tax Cuts for More Jobs, Higher Take Home Pay and Greater Prosperity Through Economic Growth</b><br />With these goals in mind, the following tax cuts should be at the heart of our alternative vision that would achieve a fundamental shift from politicians to small business, from lobbyists to entrepreneurs, and from bureaucrats to investors: <br /><br /><b>A two-year, 50% reduction in the Social Security and Medicare tax for both the employee and the employer</b>.  This provision would guarantee that virtually everyone who pays federal taxes (many of whom do not pay income tax but do pay payroll taxes) will have an immediate boost in income and that small businesses will see a dramatic increase in available cash to hire more people or make investments for the future.  This reduction would also help the cash flow problems of government at all levels, which also have to pay the employer’s match.  <br /><br />This proposal creates the opportunity for a serious conversation with every employer about how it would increase their income and give them more resources to create jobs. The revenue loss to the trust funds would be transferred from the general fund (a better use for the money than either TARP or the Politicians Spending Act of February). <br /><br />Permanently match the Chinese <b>capital gains rate</b>, which is <b>zero</b>. This is the rate Alan Greenspan testified in the late1970s was best for economic growth. It is also a relatively inexpensive thing to do in the current economy because people are going to have smaller gains. <br /><br />Match the Irish <b>corporate tax rate of 12.5%</b>. America has had the highest corporate tax system in the world (if you combine federal and state taxes). Moving to a 12.5% corporate tax rate and combining it with zero capital gains will make America the most desirable economy in the world in which to invest. <br /><br /><b>Eliminate the death tax </b>permanently. Inheritance is the most powerful accumulator of capital and eliminating the death tax has been consistently supported by over 75% of the American people. <br /><br />Give President Obama the Opportunity to Keep His Word.  Adopt the best of the small business tax proposals announced by candidate Obama in October 2008</div><br /><br />What do you guys think?  I am biased because 1) I love Newt Gingrich and 2) I have always thought lowering the corporate tax rate would be an incredible stimulus....so I like his proposal.		</div>

						I agree with Jedd about the social security thing.  I understand what he is trying to do, but it is a totally reckless and irresponsible thing to do.  The social security tax must exist if we are to keep social security around.  I am 100% for getting rid of the social security tax, but the solution is to get rid of the <i>reason</i> for the tax (social security) and not the tax itself.<br /><br />To be honest, I&#39;m not sure I agree that these measures will have the result he says they will, but since I fundamentally support them regardless, I guess I won&#39;t question that particular aspect too much.<br /><br />Of all the things he mentions, the thing I resoundingly support more than anything else is the repeal of the estate tax.  That has to be the most unconstitutional, fucked up form of taxation that has ever been passed in this country, and it is a travesty that it hasn&#39;t been repealed yet.		</div>

						woooo tax cuts.<br /><br />zero capital gains tax would be a great way for us to be more like china.  What with the crippling poverty and class immobility.<br /><br />Since you&#39;re a walking constitution, what&#39;s unconstitutional about the estate tax?  I agree it&#39;s kind of fucked up and all, but it&#39;s been upheld as constitutional repeatedly since the early twenties by the SCotUS.

						I&#39;d be willing to cut plenty, not that the general population would go along with it =&#92;.<br /><br />And during a recession the biggest problem is that the money supply is tight.  Government spending does put money into the economy but there are other ways to do that like cutting taxes and decreasing the fed lending rate.  And I would always argue that letting private individuals direct what to do with the increased money supply is better than letting the government decide what to do with the money it is printing.		</div>

Government spending does put money into the economy but there are other ways to do that like cutting taxes and decreasing the fed lending rate.  And I would always argue that letting private individuals direct what to do with the increased money supply is better than letting the government decide what to do with the money it is printing.</div><br /><br />Good.<br /><br />We can&#39;t decrease the fed anymore, it&#39;s down between 0 and 0.5%.  Unfortunately our last President squandered the opportunity to raise that rate while we were experiencing a boon because that would have destroyed our economy or something.  So it was artificially low when the recession struck, so that option is off the table.<br /><br />We can&#39;t talk about cutting taxes without cutting spending first.  But since cutting Medicar/medicaid will alienate millions upon millions of voters that&#39;s a sacred cow.  Since cutting military spending would result not in less stupid hardware (I&#39;m looking at you F-22) but rather less body armor for troops, that&#39;s a no-no.  Cutting social security right now would be very irresponsible given the number of people staring retirement in the cold ugly face and realizing for the first time in their life that all their money was fake.  And the interest on our debt is static.<br /><br />So what of the remaining 35.51% of our budget would you like to cut?		</div>

I&#39;m sure it&#39;s unconstitutional somehow, but I like it.<br /><br />Though it presupposes that Congress is beholden to the people, which is what I&#39;d call a &quot;cute&quot; idea.  Like thinking police are trying to keep you and me safe, and that banks want you to pay back your loan on time.<br /><br />I still like the idea though.  It&#39;d almost definitely be an improvement, since it would at the very least include a bigger group of people in the decision making process, rendering the decisions nigh un-makeable, and slowing down the process enough to allow for thoughtful consideration.  I doubt the thoughtful consideration would be taken, but it does provide the opportunity.<br /><br />The alternative argument would be that the interest rate is so crucial to the smooth operation of our debt-based economy that handing control of it over to a group as notoriously inefficient as US congress could delay, or even prevent a completely necessary adjustment to the rate with economically disastrous results.  But there&#39;s a tendency to make poor decisions regarding the rate anyway, so I can&#39;t say that risk scares me all that much.		</div>

Reagan was a terrible president who touted truly conservative ideals in order to further his own irresponsible economic and foreign policies.  He was a disgrace to this country and conservatism in general, so do me a huge favor and don&#39;t arbitrarily associate me with him.<br /><br />Second,<br /><br />I can play the hotlinking game, too.  <b><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">So...why has the argument shifted from substantial debate to dictionary-based semantics?</span></b></div><br /><br />Hey man, you started it.<br /><br />And I&#39;m kinda a troll, so it was kind of intended to make you reply.  Didn&#39;t mean to offend, just engage.  I&#39;m not at all surprised you feel the way you do about Raygun, and it&#39;s completely consistent with the rest of your opinions.  Which is why I said it <img src="src" alt="image" />/wink.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid=";)" border="0" alt="wink.gif" /&gt;  Fark has been unkind to my internet discourse.<br /><br />There is no substantial debate when you put up the wall of &quot;unconstitutional&quot;.  It FORCES us to dissolve a fairly interesting conversation based on the *merits* of an idea or plan into a argument about semantics.  After all, definitions are absolutely crucial to understanding our constitution.  And there is only one definition that matters to our law and that&#39;s the legal definition as defined by the supreme court, which again states:<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">&quot;2. A trustee, invested by will with full dominion over an estate, in trust to pay the net income to the testator&#39;s widow for life, and afterwards to use it for the benefit of his children and to pay over their shares as they reached a certain age, sold certain corporate stock, part of the original assets, for a price greater than their cash value on March 1, 1913. <br /><br /><b>Held (no earlier value being involved) that the gain after March 1, 1913, was taxable a income&quot;</b></div><br /><br /><br />I&#39;m confused as to why you&#39;d be annoyed with my linking.  It&#39;s support for my argument so you know I&#39;m not pulling definitions out of my ass.  Sorry I&#39;m not hosting a dictionary on my own webpage?<br /><br />Now if you want to move on from pithy semantic arguments, you&#39;d do well to avoid bringing up the constitution as the centerpiece of your rationale.  It&#39;s a beautiful document.  I love it too.  I just don&#39;t think it applies to this case, and the supreme court agrees with me.   You disagree, which is fine.  But I think we can all agree that this is fucked up and will eventually destroy our country:<br /><img src="http://markpalermo.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/cocktail.jpg.w300h300.jpg" class="linked-image" alt="image" style="border: 0px;" /><br /><br />We&#39;ve played the supply side charade for so long that we&#39;re on the cusp of having producers with no potential consumers.  Upward class mobility has been steadily decreasing over the last 25 to 30 years, and the producers of goods make far less than the producers of capital.  This is completely unsustainable and ... as a paradigm... needs to be examined with an open mind to find any real solutions.  Putting a wall up to discourse using the constitution is counter productive.  By all means, bring it up.  I&#39;m honestly impressed by your familiarity with the document.  We&#39;d be a far stronger country if we all knew as much as you.  I&#39;m always *actually* curious to hear the constitutionality argument.  But I can&#39;t even begin to discuss the pros/cons of progressive taxation vs. flat taxation with you because you&#39;ll disregard the progressive tax as unconstitutional and the flat tax as the only fair, constitutional way to tax people.		</div>

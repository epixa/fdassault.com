						While not the most intellectually stimulating interview ever, I would pay money to have our &quot;top&quot; news journalists put the heat on the candidates like this.  It&#39;s not that the main stream media stopped asking hard-hitting questions, it&#39;s that they stopped caring when the interviewee shoveled a pile of shit into their ear.		</div>

						He really didnt do a very good job.  There were a few moments where he could have really made them look stupid.  On that Whoopi asking about slavery thing all he had to do was say that there are now Amendments, which are part of the Constitution, that make that a dumb effing question.  And for separation of church and state, Whoopi asked if he would govern as he thought God willed him to do or if he would govern according to the greatest good for the people.

Then he has his tasty narrative from Vietnam to catapult a senate career.  He&#39;s done nothing to demonstrate an above average intelligence, and in fact demonstrates a minimal understanding of the issues, along with a limited capacity to discuss even the ones he does understand.<br /><br />Maybe not a moron, but he ain&#39;t the sharpest tool in the shed.

						I have an inherent tendency to disregard things that I&#39;ve been taught as true my whole life until I feel like they&#39;ve been adequately proven.  If the teachers felt the need to remind me every day, (In this case, the media itself is the teacher), that the media is liberal, I assume they are obfuscating the reality.<br /><br />Here comes the anecdote war:<br />This morning I saw Joe Scarborough and Mika  or whatever the hell her name is (MSNBC morning show), interview a wall streeter who wanted to tell us that the Golden Parachute clauses in the FM/FM CEOs&#39; contracts should be honored.  I&#39;m a liberal.  That&#39;s bullshit IMO.  There&#39;s arguments for both sides, though.  The argument for my side was never made.  There&#39;s only one... it&#39;s not that complicated.  They let him spin these CEO&#39;s as being hard working red blooded americans whose livelihoods are just as jeopardized by the crash of their company as their employees.<br /><br />/the argument btw is that when company A is absorbed by company B, company B gets to renegotiate or outright eliminate contracts with the employees of company A.  In this case, company B was the US government using the taxpayers money.  They (we) are completely within their (our) rights to request a renegotiation that doesn&#39;t involve the CEOs being rewarded for pulling the rug from underneath our economy.		</div>

						Just throwing this out there, but is it possible for reporters to have a personal preference and not let that get in the way of them reporting facts?<br /><br />A large amount of your articles point to the funding of candidates from journalists, but I don&#39;t see how that necessarily affects their reporting.  If it is possible to separate your personal life from work, would it not be possible to separate your political leanings for work?<br /><br />The numbers mean less when the fact that many of the journalists are just reading what other people wrote is brought up.  They mean even less when the fact that everything is screened by a higher up in the business.<br /><br />Don&#39;t misunderstand me.  The television (save a few) and print news do lean left.   Radio and a few television news shows are to the right.  It isn&#39;t always black and white.  Fox news (leans to the right) called McCain a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/09/15/kelly-bounds-taxes/" target="_blank">liar</a>.<br /><br />Bias is one thing, but most media outlets aren&#39;t unreasonably biased.		</div>

I&#39;ll leave it up to the American people. I still say to you, <b>and I know you&#39;re a supporter of Senator Obama</b>, if you would urge him to come and do townhall meetings with me, as I&#39;ve asked him to do time after time, the whole tenor of the campaign would change.&quot;<br /><br />Following up with a line that doesn&#39;t even apply because that&#39;s how he&#39;s playing gotcha this week.<br /><br />&quot;Obama isn&#39;t playing by my rules.

						While I tend to agree with you, perhaps choosing a different member of the media would be more appropriate.  I watch Morning Joe every day, and it is clear that Mika Brzezinski is very much an Obama supporter.  The same was true throughout the primaries as well.<br /><br />She&#39;s the type of person who twists Petraeus&#39; &quot;victory&quot; comments into &quot;Petraeus says we have no chance of victory in Iraq&quot; -- something I&#39;ve seen her do multiple times over the past few days.		</div>

						I agree, except her bias was irrelevant to the question he was being asked.<br /><br />&quot;Do you think the Obama ad, using your words about the fundamentals of the economy.  Do you think that ad was fair?&quot;<br /><br />appropriate response: No, and here&#39;s why...<br /><br />his response: you&#39;re in the tank for obama so I don&#39;t have to answer that.  Also if only Obama had come to town halls I wouldn&#39;t have to resort to the sleazy ads I&#39;m running with my name on them made by the same people who smeared me out of the running 8 years ago.<br /><br />McCain: a man of threats-<br />I won&#39;t tell you how to catch Bin-Laden unless you make me president.<br />I won&#39;t stop running lies as truth unless Obama debates me on my terms.<br /><br />I&#39;d also like to add that I thought she was in it for Hillary in the Primaries.  But I didn&#39;t watch as much then, so perhaps I just caught a few comments and judged to early.		</div>

						Yeah, Barney Frank won the debate, but it does not mean he didn&#39;t contribute to the crisis:<br />&quot;Let the Inquisition Start With Frank&quot;<br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ibdeditorials.com/IBDArticles.aspx?id=321237362312361" target="_blank">http://www.ibdeditorials.com/IBDArticles.a...321237362312361</a><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">It was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two so-called Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), that lay behind the crisis. After regulatory changes made to the Community Reinvestment Act by President Clinton in <b>1995, Fannie and Freddie went into hyper-drive, channeling literally trillions of dollars into the housing markets, using leverage and implicit taxpayers&#39; guarantees.</b><br /><br />In November 2000, President Clinton&#39;s Housing and Urban Development Department would trumpet &quot;new regulations to provide &#36;2.4 trillion in mortgages for affordable housing for 28.1 million families.&quot; The vehicles for this were Fannie and Freddie. It was the largest expansion in housing aid ever.<br /><br />Still, from the early 1990s on, many people both inside and outside Washington were alarmed by what they saw at Fannie and Freddie.<br /><br />Not Barney Frank: Starting in the early 1990s, he (and other Democrats) stood athwart efforts by regulators, Congress and the White House to get the runaway housing market under control.<br /><br /><b>He opposed reform as early as 1992. And, in response to another attempt bring Fannie-Freddie to heel in 2000, Frank responded it wasn&#39;t needed because there was &quot;no federal liability there whatsoever.&quot;<br /><br />In 2002, Frank nixed reforms again.</b> See a pattern here?<br /><br /><b>Even after federal regulators discovered in 2003 that Fannie and Freddie executives had overstated earnings by as much as &#36;10.6 billion in order to boost bonuses, Frank didn&#39;t miss a beat.</b><br /><br />President Bush pushed for what the New York Times then called &quot;the most significant regulatory overhaul in the housing finance industry since the savings and loan crisis a decade ago.&quot; [found here <a rel="nofollow" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E3D6123BF932A2575AC0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print" target="_blank">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html...agewanted=print</a> ]<br /><br />If it had passed, the housing crisis likely would have never boiled over, at least not the extent it did, taking the economy with it. Instead, led by Frank, Democrats stood as a bloc against any changes.<br /><br /><b>&quot;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not facing any kind of financial crisis,&quot; Frank, then the ranking Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, said. &quot;The more people exaggerate these problems, the more pressure there is on these companies, the less we will see in terms of affordable housing.&quot;</b><br /><br />It&#39;s hard to say why Frank did all this. It could be his close ties to the Neighborhood Assistance Corp., a powerful housing activist group based in Boston, which controls billions in loans. Or that he received some &#36;40,100 in campaign donations from Fannie and Freddie from 1989 to 2008. Or that he has been romantically linked to a one-time executive at Fannie during the 1990s.</div><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.politickerma.com/jeremyjacobs/1663/frank-hits-republicans-o-reilly-second-ad" target="_blank">http://www.politickerma.com/jeremyjacobs/1...eilly-second-ad</a><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">In his second ad of the election cycle, Congressman Barney Frank criticizes Republicans for being at the root of the current financial crisis.<br /><br />“The right wing is losing control,” the narrator says, as footage of Frank’s recent appearance on Fox News’ The O’Reilly Factor plays. <b>“For 12 years the Republic majority refused to regulate the financial system.</b> Last year, Barney Frank became chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and started working on the subprime mortgage crisis, outrageous CEO compensation and other Wall Street abuses.”</div><br />W T F, the previous article said numerous people tried to regulate/reform Fannie/Freddie and he was always against it.

This is an effort, I believe, to appeal to a kind of anger in people.”<br /><br />Frank also dismissed charges the Democrats failed on their own or blocked Republican efforts to rein in the mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

						So I was going to respond to that all at once but there&#39;s just too much of teh fail.  So instead I&#39;ll highlight it and try and explain myself.<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">It was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two so-called Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), that lay behind the crisis.</div><br />Well, yes, there were and are fundamental problems with those two institutions but some quick research reveals that nobody agrees with that 100%.  And stating such a controversial concept as fact is disingenuous of the author.  Which means he&#39;s probably going to start lying soon.<br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">He opposed reform as early as 1992.

See a pattern here?</div><br />This ignores the times where he supported tougher regulations, and also ignores the contents and substance of the regulations proposed.  Not an outright fabrication, just lying by omission and then suggesting a pattern.<br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">(re: bush&#39;s regulations) <b>If it had passed, the housing crisis likely would have never boiled over,</b> at least not the extent it did, taking the economy with it. Instead, led by Frank, Democrats stood as a bloc against any changes.</div><br />Sure.  If only the ranking democrat on a republican majority committee had ok&#39;d their reforms then they would&#39;ve made it through the house and congress which are also republican majority, and then we&#39;d all be safe and warm and really really rich.  I&#39;ll buy that...  yeah.<br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">It&#39;s hard to say why Frank did all this.

Just saying, when they turn on the shit-fire-hose instead of making targeted pointed comments, I believe they are pulling stuff out of their asses.<br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain"><b>Rep. Barney Frank said Monday that Republican criticism of Democrats over the nation’s housing crisis is a veiled attack on the poor that’s racially motivated.</b></div><br />Not sure why you bolded this.  It was a stated strategy of the republican party since Nixon.  They realized then that they couldn&#39;t win elections without having the racists on board.  But since you can&#39;t throw around the N word and win elections, they have to pussy foot around issues that marginalize the poor (read black) people in this country.  Not a secret.<br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">He said that blame is misplaced, because those loans are issued by regulated institutions, while far more foreclosures were triggered by high-cost loans made by unregulated entities.</div><br />It&#39;s a [citation needed], but it&#39;s true.  Do you know what percentage of this country&#39;s foreclosures were the result of an underregulated Fannie and Freddie?<br /><br />It&#39;s fair to question why Frank didn&#39;t do more at his position.  It&#39;s equally fair to question why, in the 12 years they held the legislature (many of those years under a like party president) did the republicans do nothing as well?  And why do none of the publications that place the blame squarely at Frank&#39;s feet mention that fact?  The final and most important question on this topic is how.<br /><br />How did Barney Frank, as a minority in the house, single handedly block the valiant efforts of republican regulators?  How did that blocking (which I contest is complete crap because even if the man opposed it 100% he simply didn&#39;t have the power or the votes) translate into toxic assets in Fannie and Freddie.  And how much of our current crisis is bundled up in those organizations?<br /><br />None of these questions are addressed above because if they are they fuck up the narrative.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />		</div>

Fair enough.  Which is why I&#39;m amazed he isn&#39;t out on the street begging for cash.<br /><br />Jedd: What do you mean &quot;following the republican line&quot;?<br /><br />Yes he&#39;s gay as sunshine.<br /><br />Informatione de Wiki:<br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Frank resides in a studio apartment complex in Newton, Massachusetts. His boyfriend, Jim Ready, 39, is a surfing enthusiast whom Frank met during a gay political fund raiser in Maine, where Ready still lives. His sister, Ann Lewis, served as a senior adviser in Hillary Clinton&#39;s 2008 presidential campaign.<br /><br /><b>Frank came out as gay in 1987</b>, &quot;prompted in part by increased media interest in his private life....&quot;  Frank&#39;s announcement had little impact on his electoral prospects. Another Congressman from Massachusetts, Gerry Studds, became the first openly gay federal legislator in 1983 when he was outed.</div><br /><br />He used to be more of a pussy, but that&#39;s a symptom of being in the house minority (notice the republicans turning into whiny bitches on January 3rd 2007)  But he has done such awesome things as reform immigration law to prevent any &quot;sexual preference exclusion&quot; from occurring and saying this:<br />&quot;In a free society a large degree of human activity is none of the government&#39;s business. We should make criminal what&#39;s going to hurt other people and other than that we should leave it to people to make their own choices.&quot;<br /><br />The man is one of my favorite politicians and has been for the past 4 years that I&#39;ve been paying attention.  It pisses me off to see him so systematically attacked for no reason other than it being too damn easy to paint a target on his back and let the republican base fire shots at him.		</div>

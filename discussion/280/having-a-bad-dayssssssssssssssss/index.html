						Having a bad day????????????????<br /> <br />According to a news report, a certain private school in Cork was recently faced with a unique problem.<br /> <br />A number of 12-year-old girls were beginning to use lipstick and would put it on in the bathroom.  That was fine, but after they put on their lipstick they would press their lips to the mirror leaving dozens of little lip prints.  Every night the maintenance man would remove them and the next day the girls would put them back.<br /> <br />Finally the principal decided that something had to be done.  She called all the girls to the bathroom and met them there with the maintenance man.  She explained that all these lip prints were causing a major problem for the custodian who had to clean the mirrors every night.<br /> <br />To demonstrate how difficult it had been to clean the mirrors, she asked the maintenance man to show the girls how much effort was required.  He took out a long-handled squeegee, dipped it in the toilet, and cleaned the mirror with it.<br /> <br />Since then, there have been no lip prints on the mirror.<br /> <br />There are teachers.... and then there are educators.<br /> <br /> <br />Things Got Ya Down?  Well Then, Consider These .. . .<br /> <br />In a hospital&#39;s Intensive Care Unit, patients always died in the same bed, on Sunday morning, at about 11:00 a.m., regardless of their medical condition.<br /> <br />This puzzled the doctors and some even thought it had something to do with the supernatural. No one could solve the mystery as to why the deaths occurred around 11:00 am Sunday, so a worldwide team of experts was assembled to investigate the cause of the incidents.<br /> <br />The next Sunday morning, a few minutes before 11:00 am, all of the doctors and nurses nervously waited outside the ward to see for themselves what the terrible phenomenon was all about. Some were holding wooden crosses, prayer books, and other holy objects to ward off the evil spirits.<br /> <br />Just when the clock struck 11:00, Pookie Johnson, the part-time Sunday sweeper, entered the ward and unplugged the life support system so he could use the vacuum cleaner.<br /> <br /> <br />Still Having a Bad Day????<br /> <br />The average cost of rehabilitating a seal after the Exxon Valdez Oil spill in Alaska was &#36;80, 000.00.<br /> <br />At a special ceremony, two of the most expensively saved animals were being released back into the wild amid cheers and applause from onlookers.<br /> <br />A minute later, in full view, a killer whale ate them both.<br /> <br /> <br />Still think you are having a Bad Day????<br /> <br />A woman came home to find her husband in the kitchen shaking frantically, almost in a dancing frenzy, with some kind of wire running from his waist towards the electric kettle. Intending to jolt him away from the deadly current, she whacked him with a handy plank of wood, breaking his arm in two places.<br /> <br />Up to that moment, he had been happily listening to his Walkman.<br /> <br /> <br />Are Ya OK. Now? - No&#33;<br /> <br />Two animal rights defenders were protesting the cruelty of sending pigs to a slaughterhouse in Bonn , Germany . Suddenly, all two thousand pigs broke loose and escaped through a broken fence,  stampeding madly.<br /> <br />The two helpless protesters were trampled to death.<br /> <br /> <br />What?? STILL having a Bad Day????<br /> <br />Iraqi terrorist Khay Rahnajet didn&#39;t pay enough postage on a letter bomb. It came back with &quot;Return to Sender&quot; stamped on it.<br /> <br />Forgetting it was the bomb, he opened it and was blown to bits.<br /> <br /> <br />There now, Feeling Better????		</div>

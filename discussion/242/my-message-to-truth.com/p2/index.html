Usually they&#39;ve tried all other types of methods and seems that the only way they can cope with it is by smoking.  By the time they want to quit, it&#39;s a lot harder for them to because of the fact that now their body is used to having nicotine and undergoes withdrawal when the body obtains deficient amounts of the chemical.<br /><br />You try being addicted to something, something that you like and that helps you destresses you  and stop all of a sudden just quit.  It&#39;s hard for many people.</div><br /><br />I know someone at 56 that smoked for 35 years quit cold turkey, however i should have made that point more clear, you&#39;re hooked because when you were younger you were oblivious to the damage that they would undoubtable cause, for someone to even think about their method of advertisment being wrong, makes me want to question their sanity.<br /><br />It&#39;s as was said before directed to young adults and even teenagers that think it&#39;s cool. Not to the adults who are hooked and &quot;can&#39;t&quot; quit because it is &quot;alot harder&quot;. The whole point of truth in my opinion is to keep this from happening to people ASAP, not try to save the ones that have already passed the SR point.		</div>

						Allow me to point something out ...  Unless you yourself are addicted to anything, which given your random self righteous bullshit, you yourself are not, you have no idea how hard it is to quit, anything.  Good for that 56 year old, and believe me, I wish I could quick without literally losing all of my focus on schoolwork, despite gum, patch, or pill, because believe me I&#39;ve tried them all...  You see, here&#39;s the problem.  We all have these things called personalities.  And each &quot;personality&quot; is different.  So you, one person can quit no problem after 35 years, and yet, inexplicably, there&#39;s some kid hooked after the first pack wo loses his shit if you deprive him of a smoke for 4 hours, and literally has a hard time functioning.  <br /><br />And no, I was never oblivious to the damage it caused.  I was told from the time I was conscious, till my teens, till now...  If you can&#39;t understand from a VERY young age that this shit is bad for you, you deserve whatever is coming...  If you understand it, and accept it, then what the FUCK are truth adds going to do?  <br /><br />Anyway, I hope you&#39;re all enjoying trying to save humanity, or whatever the fuck you think you&#39;re doing that you all seem so confident in.  To be honest, we have too many fucking people here already, and if it&#39;s the smokers who are going to die early and make it easier for the rest of the people to life comfortably, than so be it.  Coming from a smoker, seriously.  But I hope when you&#39;re getting older and having kids, you can at least display some level of logic better than this, and make them understand the concepts which you, in the larger scheme, seem to miss...  Either way, at least explain to them better the concepts of capitalism, which you all failed to learn.  In an economy, at least one pretending to be free market, a company does no fund adds directly in opposition to it&#39;s own interest.  This is similar to how the poor shouldn&#39;t help fund a war that benefits only the rich.  It doesn&#39;t work.  <br /><br />Anyway, despite my more than slightly slanted, drunken, and more than angry commentary, I hope you all die in a fire.<br /><br />Yeah, even those of you who agree with me.<br /><br />Fuck off.<br /><br />Bill... <br /><br />Yours truly.<br /><br />Fuck yourselves		</div>

My father smokes and I hate the fact and I keep telling him to stop because I don&#39;t want to fucking see him die any soon because of that stupid shit called cigarettes. If you really want to stop, choose a good moment and it will be possible. You might have problems with school at the same time you try but it&#39;s so fucking worth it for what it gives you after.

Bringing smoking up so often isn&#39;t going to help.  Sure, learning that it&#39;s bad for you is important to prevent people from picking up the habit, but when I see every other commercial/billboard/magazine ad about smoking (good or bad), I&#39;m seeing people smoke.  If you want the public to not smoke, remove it from media completely.  <br /><br />If I never see anyone smoke, chances are I&#39;m not going to start.  I understand the flaw in that argument as well.  I&#39;m going to see other people smoking outside.  When was the last time you thought someone looked cool smoking a cigarette? I know I laugh every time I see  my roommate going outside when it&#39;s cold and wet and disgusting outside, just so he can get his nicotine fix.  Face it.  Cigarettes have lost all cool appeal.  On the boardwalk, you have to get in a glass box just to smoke one.  I find it more demeaning to people who do smoke.<br /><br />Simply remove as much smoking propaganda as possible and less people will pick up the habit.<br /><br />That&#39;s my two cents anyway, take it or leave it.		</div>

[insert joke about lethal/dan/weed/etc. here]<br /><br />Anyway, I think forcing the tobacco companies to run anti-smoking ads was a terrible idea to begin with.  Bringing smoking up so often isn&#39;t going to help.  Sure, learning that it&#39;s bad for you is important to prevent people from picking up the habit, but when I see every other commercial/billboard/magazine ad about smoking (good or bad), I&#39;m seeing people smoke.  If you want the public to not smoke, remove it from media completely.  <br /><br />If I never see anyone smoke, chances are I&#39;m not going to start.  I understand the flaw in that argument as well.  I&#39;m going to see other people smoking outside.  When was the last time you thought someone looked cool smoking a cigarette? I know I laugh every time I see  my roommate going outside when it&#39;s cold and wet and disgusting outside, just so he can get his nicotine fix.  Face it.  Cigarettes have lost all cool appeal.  On the boardwalk, you have to get in a glass box just to smoke one.  I find it more demeaning to people who do smoke.<br /><br />Simply remove as much smoking propaganda as possible and less people will pick up the habit.<br /><br />That&#39;s my two cents anyway, take it or leave it.</div><br /><br />have fun trying to remove it from cinema&#33;<br /><br />what you&#39;re suggesting is censorship. Maybe we should replace all guns with walkie talkies in movies and tv shows too since guns are also cool but dangerous		</div>

I&#39;m not looking for the anti-hero Vincent Vega.  Tyler Durden was insane and when he wasn&#39;t he didn&#39;t smoke... coincidence? If you watch the Simpsons, you know that anytime Krusty lights up, he goes from being the fun kid&#39;s idol into a human flawed person.  The cigarettes are there to show that he is flawed, imperfect, and NOT a role model.</div><br />okay, let&#39;s say hypothetically in the next superman movie, there&#39;s a scene with supe smoking because there was something about &#36;10 million in cash that brian singer couldn&#39;t ignore. and superman only does it because lex luthor bet him he couldn&#39;t continually smoke while running and winning the boston marathon. now imagine you&#39;re some 15 year old kid (knock your IQ down 30 points). would you seriously think a dude who wears a red speedo outside his blue tights is cooler than the ultra-suave vince vega, even disregarding the hypotheticals? is there any question that marv (sin city) is more awesome than any of toby mcguire&#39;s spider-men characters?<br /><br />and thank you for saying that bit about krusty, as it is the entire point you&#39;ve failed to catch. Humans are so flawed its retarded, and some of those flaws include addiction and a tendency to be easily swayed. but to combat those deficiencies we have the ability to make logical and rational decisions about certain stimuli on a higher level than other organisms. however we, especially the next generation of kids growing up, can only do this with enough information, which strangely is what you want censored.		</div>

						That&#39;s a shame for those people, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that there are a lot of people out there that are affected by information about the risks of smoking.

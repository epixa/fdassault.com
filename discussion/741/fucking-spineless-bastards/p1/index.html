						So do you want the wireless phone companies to help the country when we need it or be pissed that we opened them up to prosecution for wiretapping foreigners with links to terrorists?

						No one, not any person anywhere in this country or any other, has the authority to tell any individual, group, corporation, or even arm of the government that they can directly or indirectly violate the Constitution.  The president is no exception.  The second you belittle the Constitution in the littlest bit is the second the Constitution&#39;s value is void, and it is _only_ the Constitution that stands between a nation run by free men and a country run by tyrants.  Bush betrayed his oath and his country when he issued that executive order, and all of the telecommunication companies that listened to him broke the supreme laws that define and protect everything that is right about our great nation.  He is no more than a tyrant, and they are no more than criminals, and now the congress is no more than a bunch of traitorous appeasers.<br /><br />They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.		</div>

To <b>win immunity, they would have to pass review from a U.S. District Court.</b></div><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Critical to sealing the deal was a compromise that would grant conditional immunity to telecommunications companies for assistance they provided from September 2001 through January 2007. <b>If the companies can show a federal district court judge “substantial evidence” they received a written request from the attorney general or head of an intelligence agency stating the president authorized the surveillance and determined it to be lawful, the cases against them will be dismissed.</b></div><br />Some justice&#33;<br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">The compromise would overhaul a 1978 law known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, enacted in the wake of Nixon-era abuses in which the NSA and other agencies spied on political enemies.

						Here&#39;s one article on how the FBI uses the Patriot Act to get around warrants.  They use National Security Letters (NSLs) which used to only be allowed to be used against suspected terrorists or spies (before 9/11), but that restriction got changed via Patriot Act.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/03/warrantless_searches.html" target="_blank">http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/200...s_searches.html</a><br /><br />There are many more articles similar to that.

It&#39;s all well and good now, but this law will stick around far beyond its intended use for any future administration to use as they see fit.  It says that if the government asks the telecom companies for help or information of any sort, then there is NO LEGAL RECOURSE WHATSOEVER for the person whose information has been acquired.  And this is a type of immunity that didn&#39;t exist -AT ALL- at the time when the government initially asked these companies to break the law to help them.  They were put in a precarious position, but were within their legal right to deny the government permission to see this information, but were so afraid of their lobbyists being ignored they played right along and then had all their lobbyists bitch and moan to congress to get something like this in place before they had their feet held to the fire.		</div>

I think we&#39;ve pretty well blurred the line.  It&#39;s easy enough to say, &quot;If the terrorist is a citizen of the USA and the attack occurred on our soil then it&#39;s domestic.&quot;  But what if that citizen is considered a Hamas sympathizer?  What if he&#39;s a known anti-semite?  Won&#39;t these things be cited as evidence that this is an international threat?  Not to be overly dramatic, I just don&#39;t trust this qualifier without knowing more about how they are defining their terms.<br /><br />As for not being able to acquire the content of communications, why do you think we did away with that pesky limitation by making acquisition of those communications available simply by asking the telecom companies and making it impossible to sue them?<br /><br />They are eroding YOUR rights when they erode the rights of any other American.

Ron Paul, M.D.<br /><br />Madam Speaker, I regret that due to the unexpected last-minute appearance of this measure on the legislative calendar this week, a prior commitment has prevented me from voting on the FISA amendments. I have strongly opposed every previous FISA overhaul attempt and I certainly would have voted against this one as well.<br /><br />The main reason I oppose this latest version is that it still clearly violates the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution by allowing the federal government to engage in the bulk collection of American citizens’ communications without a search warrant. That US citizens can have their private communication intercepted by the government without a search warrant is anti-American, deeply disturbing, and completely unacceptable.<br /><br />In addition to gutting the fourth amendment, this measure will deprive Americans who have had their rights violated by telecommunication companies involved in the Administration’s illegal wiretapping program the right to seek redress in the courts for the wrongs committed against them. Worse, this measure provides for retroactive immunity, whereby individuals or organizations that broke the law as it existed are granted immunity for prior illegal actions once the law has been changed. Ex post facto laws have long been considered anathema in free societies under rule of law. Our Founding Fathers recognized this, including in Article I section 9 of the Constitution that “No bill of attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.” How is this FISA bill not a variation of ex post facto? That alone should give pause to supporters of this measure.<br /><br />Mr. Speaker, we should understand that decimating the protections that our Constitution provides us against the government is far more dangerous to the future of this country than whatever external threats may exist. We can protect this country without violating the Constitution and I urge my colleagues to reconsider their support for this measure.</div>		</div>

						In defense of this (I know) I&#39;d like to say that if we&#39;re this pissed off at telecoms then we need to recalibrate our rage-o-meters.  The only reason I&#39;d want to be able to see some legal ass kicking of these guys is so that there would be some kind of discovery done into the methods our leaders used to obtain this shit from them.  I imagine it&#39;s all fairly questionable.<br /><br />Govt: Ahmoud Tali is suspected of terrorism.  Please provide any information you can to help our investigation.<br />Telecom: I&#39;m sorry that is against the law.<br />Govt: We will be launching an investigation into your corporate practices later this week.  Thank you for your help.<br /><br />This isn&#39;t to excuse their actions, but I think it&#39;s important to keep things in perspective.  The real criminals here are our government.<br /><br />With that aside, this bill (as I understand it) actually seeks to curb some of these shady practices and deals.  That&#39;s why immunity needed to be left in to get enough support to pass the important part; the part which makes this crap harder to do.		</div>

						The thing is, the government isn&#39;t the only criminal in this one.  They broke the law, period.<br /><br />If I pressured my buddy into murder, he&#39;d still get charged for murder.  If he&#39;s lucky, he&#39;d get off a bit easier than I would, but he wouldn&#39;t simply walk.  If the president asked me to murder my neighbor (a suspected terrorist), I&#39;d tell him to suck a dick.  They have some of the best lawyers on this planet, I guarantee they knew it wasn&#39;t lawful.  They were playing dirty politics, and they were caught red-handed.  It is an added bonus that investigations into the involvement of telecoms could yield information about the methods our leaders used to pressure them into committing this extremely severe felony.		</div>

						I don&#39;t disagree with the fact that they are criminals.  I&#39;m just saying that they had to choose what kind of criminals to be.  Ones the government liked, or ones they didn&#39;t.  No corporation would say no.  None.  Plus, if they said no and were getting investigated for some random crap they&#39;d see shareholders jumping ship.<br /><br />Punishing them wouldn&#39;t teach them anything.  If every single company was charged with the maximum whatever, I&#39;d still expect them to make the same choice if this came up again next year.  But if there were some sort of investigation into the administrations role in this kind of activity maybe THEY would think twice about asking in the first place.<br /><br />/2c		</div>

						I&#39;m not so much trying to justify the telecoms complicity in these shenanigans.  They were in a shitty place mostly because of shady shit they&#39;ve been doing for years.  (You don&#39;t hear about Vonage getting asked to spy on people... just the giants with HUGE amounts of history)  What I <i>am</i> trying to get across though is that I&#39;m FAR more interested in the other side of the coin.  If we were allowed to prosecute them it would rock but it would result in them losing some money.  Damn.  But if we still persue legal action against them all they have to do is show us the order from our government asking them to break the law; orders which would otherwise be effectively non-existent; and they get off scott free.  I want this administration to get this mud smeared all over its face more than I want to see these companies punished.  Punishing the real perpetrators* is more important to me.<br /><br />*not that I think it will happen...		</div>

						<b>1. What do you think of when you hear the word &quot;technology?&quot;</b><br /><br />New and innovative inventions that help discover the undiscovered, advance productivity, and simplify the once difficult.<br /><br /><b>2.

What a waste.<br /><br />What is this paper for?</div><br /><b><br />Thanks for the reply very good answers.</b><br />This paper is for a class I&#39;m taking &quot;Cultural Dynamics of Technology.&quot;  Our assignment is to interview 3 different age groups / not all of the same sex and write a paper including their thoughts about technology.  <br /><br />You hit the nail on the head though, both of the other interviews described technology as &quot;computers.&quot; That is not it at all, that is just an extension of tech.  <br /><br />The class itself is rather interesting.  The professor has taught for 40 years and loves the topic he teaches.  He&#39;s a knowledge bank of useful facts and useless trivia questions.  Our other papers so far were to write about some kind of historical technology so I wrote about weaponry before gunpowder.  Our most recent was diversity in technology, so I chose to write about how the Amish live and what tech some of the orders do allow.  <br /><br />I don&#39;t know, its a nice change from all of my technical flight courses thats for sure.<br />		</div>

						That does sound really interesting.  Cartoon brought up a thought that I had but didn&#39;t know where to put in the survey:<br /><br />What would happen if we took all of the resources we have invested in using technology as a weapon (military research, materials, and processing) and instead invested it in technology that immediately improves the standard of life (medical research, better food manufacturing, the environment)?  Would the terrorists still hate us if we helped them improve their hospitals and overall happiness?<br /><br />I don&#39;t know.  Just an incomplete thought that came to mind.		</div>

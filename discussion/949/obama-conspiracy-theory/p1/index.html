						<a rel="nofollow" href="http://patdollard.com/2008/09/barack-obama-and-the-strategy-of-manufactured-crisis/" target="_blank">http://patdollard.com/2008/09/barack-obama...actured-crisis/</a><br />Basically it says that Obama is the hand-chosen Presidential pick of groups who want to force communism in this country through creating layers upon layers of crises.  I know it sounds stupid and the article is definitely partisan, but I felt like there was some interesting information in it.  soooooo I dare you to read it&#33;&#33;<br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">The Strategy was first elucidated in the May 2, 1966 issue of The Nation magazine by a pair of radical socialist Columbia University professors, Richard Andrew Cloward and Frances Fox Piven. David Horowitz summarizes it as:<br />The strategy of forcing political change through orchestrated crisis. <b>The “Cloward-Piven Strategy” seeks to hasten the fall of capitalism by overloading the government bureaucracy with a flood of impossible demands, thus pushing society into crisis and economic collapse.</b>Cloward and Piven were inspired by radical organizer [and Hillary Clinton mentor] Saul Alinsky:<br /><br />“Make the enemy live up to their (sic) own book of rules,” Alinsky wrote in his 1989 book Rules for Radicals. When pressed to honor every word of every law and statute, every Judeo-Christian moral tenet, and every implicit promise of the liberal social contract, human agencies inevitably fall short. The system’s failure to “live up” to its rule book can then be used to discredit it altogether, and to replace the capitalist “rule book” with a socialist one.</div><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">No matter where the strategy is implemented, it shares the following features:<br />The offensive organizes previously unorganized groups eligible for government benefits but not currently receiving all they can.<br /><b>The offensive seeks to identify new beneficiaries and/or create new benefits.</b>The overarching aim is always to impose new stresses on target systems, with the ultimate goal of forcing their collapse.<br />Capitalizing on the racial unrest of the 1960s, Cloward and Piven saw the welfare system as their first target.</div><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">As they gleefully observed:<br />Moreover, this kind of mass influence is cumulative because benefits are continuous. Once eligibility for basic food and rent grants is established, <b>the drain on local resources persists indefinitely.</b></div><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">In 1970, one of George Wiley’s protégés, Wade Rathke — like Bill Ayers, a member of the radical Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) — was sent to found the Arkansas Community Organizations for Reform Now. While NWRO had made a good start, it alone couldn’t accomplish the Cloward-Piven goals. Rathke’s group broadened the offensive to include a wide array of low income “rights.” Shortly thereafter they changed “Arkansas” to “Association of” and <b>ACORN</b> went nationwide.</div><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">ACORN’s voter rights tactics follow the Cloward-Piven Strategy:<br />1. Register as many Democrat voters as possible, legal or otherwise and help them vote, multiple times if possible.<br />2. Overwhelm the system with fraudulent registrations using multiple entries of the same name, names of deceased, random names from the phone book, even contrived names.<br />3. Make the system difficult to police by lobbying for minimal identification standards.<br />In this effort, ACORN sets up registration sites all over the country and has been frequently cited for turning in fraudulent registrations, as well as destroying republican applications. In the 2004-2006 election cycles alone, ACORN was accused of widespread voter fraud in 12 states. It may have swung the election for one state governor.</div><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Barack Obama ran ACORN’s Project Vote in Chicago and his highly successful voter registration drive was credited with getting the disgraced former Senator Carol Moseley-Braun elected.</div><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Obama aided ACORN as their lead attorney in a successful suit he brought against the Illinois state government to implement the Motor Voter law there. The law had been resisted by Republican Governor Jim Edgars, who feared the law was an opening to widespread vote fraud. <br /><br />His fears were warranted as the Motor Voter law has since been cited as a major opportunity for vote fraud, especially for illegal immigrants, even terrorists. According to the Wall Street Journal: “After 9/11, the Justice Department found that eight of the 19 hijackers were registered to vote…”</div><br />**<br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">It originated with the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), signed into law in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. The CRA was Carter’s answer to a grassroots activist movement started in Chicago, and forced banks to make loans to low income, high risk customers. PhD economist and former Texas Senator Phil Gramm has called it: “a vast extortion scheme against the nation’s banks.”<br /><br /><b>ACORN aggressively sought to expand loans to low income groups using the CRA as a whip.</b> Economist Stan Leibowitz wrote in the New York Post:<br />In the 1980s, groups such as the activists at <b>ACORN began pushing charges of “redlining”-claims that banks discriminated against minorities in mortgage lending.</b> In 1989, sympathetic members of Congress got the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act amended to force banks to collect racial data on mortgage applicants; this allowed various studies to be ginned up that seemed to validate the original accusation.<br />In fact, minority mortgage applications were rejected more frequently than other applications-but the overwhelming reason wasn’t racial discrimination, but simply that minorities tend to have weaker finances.<br /><br />ACORN showed its colors again in 1991, by taking over the House Banking Committee room for two days to protest efforts to scale back the CRA. <b>Obama represented ACORN in the Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank, 1994 suit against redlining. Most significant of all, ACORN was the driving force behind a 1995 regulatory revision pushed through by the Clinton Administration that greatly expanded the CRA and laid the groundwork for the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac borne financial crisis we now confront. Barack Obama was the attorney representing ACORN in this effort. With this new authority, ACORN used its subsidiary, ACORN Housing, to promote subprime loans more aggressively.</b><br /><br />As a New York Post article describes it:<br />A 1995 strengthening of the Community Reinvestment Act required banks to find ways to provide mortgages to their poorer communities. It also let community activists intervene at yearly bank reviews, shaking the banks down for large pots of money.<br /><br />Banks that got poor reviews were punished; some saw their merger plans frustrated; others faced direct legal challenges by the Justice Department.<br />Flexible lending programs expanded even though they had higher default rates than loans with traditional standards. On the Web, you can still find CRA loans available via ACORN with “100 percent financing . . . no credit scores . . . undocumented income . . . even if you don’t report it on your tax returns.” Credit counseling is required, of course.<br /><br /><b>Ironically, an enthusiastic Fannie Mae Foundation report singled out one paragon of nondiscriminatory lending, which worked with community activists and followed “the most flexible underwriting criteria permitted.” That lender’s &#36;1 billion commitment to low-income loans in 1992 had grown to &#36;80 billion by 1999 and &#36;600 billion by early 2003. <br /><br />The lender they were speaking of was Countrywide</b>, which specialized in subprime lending and had a working relationship with ACORN.<br /><br />Investor’s Business Daily added:<br />The revisions also allowed for the first time the securitization of CRA-regulated loans containing subprime mortgages. The changes came as radical “housing rights” groups led by ACORN lobbied for such loans. ACORN at the time was represented by a young public-interest lawyer in Chicago by the name of Barack Obama.</div><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain"><b>As a community activist for ACORN; as a leadership trainer for ACORN; as a lead organizer for ACORN’s Project Vote; as an attorney representing ACORN’s successful efforts to impose Motor Voter regulations in Illinois; as ACORN’s representative in lobbying for the expansion of high risk housing loans through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that led to the current crisis</b>; as a recipient of their assistance in his political campaigns — both with money and campaign workers; it is doubtful that he was unaware of ACORN’s true goals. It is doubtful he was unaware of the Cloward-Piven Strategy.</div><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">As a young attorney in the 1990s, Barack Obama represented ACORN in Washington in their successful efforts to expand Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) authority. In addition to making it easier for ACORN groups to force banks into making risky loans, <b>this also paved the way for banks like Superior to package mortgages as investments, and for the Government Sponsored Enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to underwrite them. These changes created the conditions that ultimately lead to the current financial crisis.</b></div>		</div>

						And that&#39;s why I don&#39;t bother with Pat Dollard&#39;s blog.<br /><br />My consipiracy theory:<br />McCain was brainwashed while imprisoned in Vietnam and is set to bring communism to us all through lowering taxes to a point well beyond the ability of government to run at all, let alone effectively thus leading to the complete collapse of our economic system in an attempt to salvage the failing government.  The end result is a government that nationalizes all our country&#39;s failures and pockets the successes.<br /><br />/protip: you don&#39;t even read crap stretched this thin on Kos, dude.  If you need 6 pages to tell me that Obama wants to steal my money, its probably safe to say that he doesn&#39;t want to steal my money.<br /><br />okay fine, some content:<br /><br />&quot;The system&#8217;s failure to &#8220;live up&#8221; to its rule book can then be used to discredit it altogether, and to replace the capitalist &#8220;rule book&#8221; with a socialist one.&quot;<br /><br />lolwut?  Yeah that&#39;ll totally happen...<br /><br />meanwhile, Obama&#39;s already said that this bailout will dramatically effect his plans for new programs or growth of existing programs.

						I know he doesn&#39;t write most of the crap on his site, but most of the crap on his site is still reaching beyond all reasonable means in an effort to make the Democratic candidate look like he&#39;s a corrupt, evil man and none say anything nice about either candidate.  But nary a word is spoken about say... the Keating 5... or McCain&#39;s violations of McCain-Feingold...<br /><br />I don&#39;t read Kos, DU, WND, NRO, Dollard, Gengrich, Malkin, or Coulter unless I&#39;m sent there.  And I usually regret doing so when I am.<br /><br />I also suggest you read more about ACORN than what&#39;s on blogs.  They pay their employees based on the successes they have in voter registration.  This does foster some shady practices on the individual level, but are typically due to lack of organization rather than an organized effort to undermine democracy.  A total of 15 employees have been indicted for voter registration fraud out of a total of 70,000 employees.  Meanwhile YPM is a republican voter registration and community organization organization (I love how that works, don&#39;t you &quot;organization organization&quot;... beautiful).  It&#39;s also been investigated over and over for <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sptimes.com/2004/10/23/Hillsborough/Students_complain_of_.shtml" target="_blank">voter fraud</a>:<br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Young Political Majors LLC, or YPM, is a company registered by Mark Jacoby at a Town &#39;N Country residence.<br /><br />Jacoby appeared this summer at the election office in Gainesville with a box of about 1,200 voter registration cards. Of those, about 510 voters had switched to the GOP.<br /><br />Elections Supervisor Beverly Hill spoke with Jacoby and grew suspicious. She randomly called the Republicans to verify they wanted to switch. All of them said, &quot;Absolutely not,&quot; Hill said. &quot;They didn&#39;t even know they had signed a registration form,&quot; Hill said.</div><br /><br />and hey, if I dig I bet I can find some sort of connection between Nehring and McCain.<br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://politickerca.com/alexisenstadt/1000/mccain-camp-whitman-fundraiser-nets-25-million" target="_blank">yep</a><br />They were at a McCain fundraiser together.

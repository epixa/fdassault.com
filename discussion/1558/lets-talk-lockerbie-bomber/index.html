						I wasn&#39;t sure where to put this story, but I&#39;ll put it here.<br /><br />For those who don&#39;t know the story here it is...<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">(CNN) -- The only man convicted over the Lockerbie bombing is to be released and allowed to return to Libya on compassionate grounds because he is terminally ill, Scotland&#39;s justice minister said Thursday.<br /> Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, now 57, is suffering from terminal prostate cancer.<br /> <br /> Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi 57 was serving a life sentence for bombing Pan Am Flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie, resulting in the deaths of 270 people.<br /> <br /> The White House, which has urged Britain to keep al Megrahi behind bars, said it &quot;deeply regrets&quot; the decision.<br /> <br /> Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill told a news conference in Edinburgh the prisoner was &quot;going home to die&quot; and would be released within an hour of the announcement shortly after 1200 GMT (8 a.m. ET).<br /> <br /> &quot;Our justice system demands that judgment be imposed but compassion available,&quot; MacAskill said. &quot;Our beliefs dictate that justice be served but mercy be shown.&quot;<br /> <br /> The Pan Am flight exploded December 21, 1988, as it flew over Scotland on its way from London to New York. All 259 people aboard the plane died, along with 11 Scots on the ground.<br /> <br /> The United States has made clear to the British government and others that it believes al Megrahi should spend the rest of his time in jail.<br /> <br /> In a statement released shortly after Thursday&#39;s announcement, the White House said it &quot;deeply regrets the decision&quot;.<br /> <br /> &quot;As we have expressed repeatedly to officials of the government of the United Kingdom and to Scottish authorities, we continue to believe that al Megrahi should serve out his sentence in Scotland,&quot; it said.<br /> <br /> Al Megrahi was convicted in 2001 after the prosecution argued he had placed the bomb, hidden in a suitcase, on a flight from Malta to Frankfurt, Germany.<br /> <br /> There, prosecutors said, the bomb was transferred onto the Pan Am plane that went first to London&#39;s Heathrow Airport and then took off for New York.<br /> <br /> Another man -- Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima -- was also tried in the bombing but was acquitted.<br /> <br /> The prosecution said that al Megrahi, who worked at Malta&#39;s Luqa Airport, was an agent for the Libyan intelligence services and had been seen buying clothes that were in the suitcase that contained the bomb.<br /> <br /> Libya has formally accepted responsibility for the bombing and has compensated the families, though Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi later denied any culpability.<br /> <br /> A Scottish court ruled in 2003 that al Megrahi must serve at least 27 years of his sentence before becoming eligible for parole. Al Megrahi first appealed the conviction in 2002 and lost.</div><br /><br />however, there is a new development.<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain"><b>Lockerbie bomber &#39;set free for oil&#39;</b><br /> Jason Allardyce<br /> <br /> The British government decided it was “in the overwhelming interests of the United Kingdom” to make Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi, the Lockerbie bomber, eligible for return to Libya, leaked ministerial letters reveal.<br /> <br /> Gordon Brown’s government made the decision after discussions between Libya and BP over a multi-million-pound oil exploration deal had hit difficulties. These were resolved soon afterwards.<br /> <br /> The letters were sent two years ago by Jack Straw, the justice secretary, to Kenny MacAskill, his counterpart in Scotland, who has been widely criticised for taking the formal decision to permit Megrahi’s release.<br /> <br /> The correspondence makes it plain that the key decision to include Megrahi in a deal with Libya to allow prisoners to return home was, in fact, taken in London for British national interests.<br /> <br /> Edward Davey, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, said: “This is the strongest evidence yet that the British government has been involved for a long time in talks over al-Megrahi in which commercial considerations have been central to their thinking.”<br /> <br /> Two letters dated five months apart show that Straw initially intended to exclude Megrahi from a prisoner transfer agreement with Colonel Muammar Gadaffi, under which British and Libyan prisoners could serve out their sentences in their home country.<br /> <br /> In a letter dated July 26, 2007, Straw said he favoured an option to leave out Megrahi by stipulating that any prisoners convicted before a specified date would not be considered for transfer.<br /> <br /> Downing Street had also said Megrahi would not be included under the agreement.<br /> <br /> Straw then switched his position as Libya used its deal with BP as a bargaining chip to insist the Lockerbie bomber was included.<br /> <br /> The exploration deal for oil and gas, potentially worth up to £15 billion, was announced in May 2007. Six months later the agreement was still waiting to be ratified.<br /> <br /> On December 19, 2007, Straw wrote to MacAskill announcing that the UK government was abandoning its attempt to exclude Megrahi from the prisoner transfer agreement, citing the national interest.<br /> <br /> In a letter leaked by a Whitehall source, he wrote: “I had previously accepted the importance of the al-Megrahi issue to Scotland and said I would try to get an exclusion for him on the face of the agreement. I have not been able to secure an explicit exclusion.<br /> <br /> “The wider negotiations with the Libyans are reaching a critical stage and, in view of the overwhelming interests for the United Kingdom, I have agreed that in this instance the [prisoner transfer agreement] should be in the standard form and not mention any individual.”<br /> <br /> Within six weeks of the government climbdown, Libya had ratified the BP deal. The prisoner transfer agreement was finalised in May this year, leading to Libya formally applying for Megrahi to be transferred to its custody.<br /> <br /> Saif Gadaffi, the colonel’s son, has insisted that negotiation over the release of Megrahi was linked with the BP oil deal: “The fight to get the [transfer] agreement lasted a long time and was very political, but I want to make clear that we didn’t mention Mr Megrahi.<br /> <br /> “At all times we talked about the [prisoner transfer agreement]. It was obvious we were talking about him. We all knew that was what we were talking about.<br /> <br /> “People should not get angry because we were talking about commerce or oil. We signed an oil deal at the same time. The commerce and oil deals were all with the [prisoner transfer agreement].”<br /> <br /> His account is confirmed by other sources. Sir Richard Dalton, a former British ambassador to Libya and a board member of the Libyan British Business Council, said: “Nobody doubted Libya wanted BP and BP was confident its commitment would go through. But the timing of the final authority to spend real money was dependent on politics.”<br /> <br /> Bob Monetti of New Jersey, whose son Rick was among the victims of the 1988 bombing, said: “It’s always been about business.”<br /> <br /> BP denied that political factors were involved in the deal’s ratification or that it had stalled during negotiations over the prisoner transfer talks.<br /> <br /> A Ministry of Justice spokesman denied there had been a U-turn, but said trade considerations had been a factor in negotiating the prisoner exchange deal. He said Straw had unsuccessfully tried to accommodate the wish of the Scottish government to exclude Megrahi from agreement.<br /> <br /> The spokesman claimed the deal was ultimately “academic” because Megrahi had been released on compassionate grounds: “The negotiations on the [transfer agreement] were part of wider negotiations aimed at the normalisation of relations with Libya, which included a range of areas, including trade.<br /> <br /> “The exclusion or inclusion of Megrahi would not serve any practical purpose because the Scottish executive always had a veto on whether to transfer him.”<br /> <br /> A spokesman for Lord Mandelson said he had not changed his position that the release of Megrahi was not linked to trade deals.</div><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6814939.ece" target="_blank">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/poli...icle6814939.ece</a>		</div>

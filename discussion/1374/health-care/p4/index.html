There is no corrupt deal on my side or the manager&#39;s side, there is simply a Customer Service Clerk who isn&#39;t doing their job properly.</b><br /><br />And as for providing an example? Kind of hard to do when medical information is considered confidential and most of the Veteran&#39;s affected aren&#39;t out for publicity, so it is generally kept low-key to the point that the only way you hear about it is by means of knowing the persons being affected.</div><br /><br />So what you were describing is not some gross inefficiency or even a mild damnation of the VA.  You were just saying that sometimes your claim is denied until you call and get it straightened out.  Unless you&#39;re saying that you need to be related to the manager too, in which case, yeah... I&#39;d call that corruption.  So... what&#39;s your point again?<br /><br />I feel compelled to point out that it seems strange that the VA would be so absolutely terrible, so bad in fact that it serves as an example to dissuade us from pursuing any other nationalized health insurance systems, and yet so many veterans choose to use it.  If private insurance is better than at least SOME veterans would say &quot;fuck off&quot; to the VA.		</div>

Just take two steps back, and realize what a hypocrite you are when &quot;national security&quot; is at stake. And take it easy.  The patriot act, supported by every dick that was SCARED SHITLESS by the THREAT of a TERRORIST action on our own soil, which HAD happen before, and which we dealt with without destroying the constitution.  But now...  You know.  They&#39;re brown.  Do fuck em up.. Declare ware.  Or whatever it is you want.  Fuck the poor etc.  Good work.  Bound to end well.<br /><br />Maybe you&#39;ll get your well...

						I got a little into that list.  The guy is clearly carrying water for the Republicans and might be, I suspect, a birther...

The government can already audit those books.  If you&#39;re not doing anything wrong you&#39;ve got nothing to fear, right?</b><br />Pg 30 Sec 123 of HC bill - THERE WILL BE A GOVT COMMITTEE that decides what treatments/benefits you get <b>As opposed to a *for-profit* corporate committee...</b><br />Pg 29 lines 4-16 in the HC bill - YOUR HEALTHCARE IS RATIONED&#33;&#33;&#33;  <b>Vague... ok.  Well it is already.  So excuse me while I don&#39;t shit myself over this concern.</b><br />Pg 42 of HC Bill - The Health Choices Commissioner will choose your benefits for you. You have no choice&#33;  <b>Bullshit.  Overt hyperbole.  &quot;you have no choice&#33;&quot;...?  it&#39;s not even THINLY veiled.</b><br />Pg 50 Section 152 in HC bill - HC will be provided to ALL non US citizens, illegal or otherwise <b>It already is, at higher cost.  And IMO, this is not a bad thing.</b><br />Pg 58HC Bill - Govt will have real-time access to individual&#8217;s finances &amp; a National ID Health care card will be issued&#33;   <b>HAHAHAHAHAHAHA&#33;  The National ID card is gonna come up a lot.  Whatever...</b><br />Pg 59 HC Bill lines 21-24 Govt will have direct access to your banks accts for electronic funds transfer. <b>In what capacity.  Nothing in legislation is unilateral.

						Only argument against it that&#39;s worth a damn as far as I&#39;m concerned is that we already have a national ID card, and that line of debate sounds suspiciously like it&#39;s lacking crucial information.  Much as I&#39;m.<br /><br />But damnit.  The purpose of the card is to allow faster and simpler access to health information *wherever* you choose to go.  You&#39;re records aren&#39;t locked in your doctor&#39;s office anymore, they&#39;re in your pocket... or rather, on a server that has to meet EXTREMELY strict security requirements.  That reduces cost overhead for every hospital, and doctors office, which SHOULD make fiscally responsible people happy.  But no.  Instead it&#39;s some scary way to keep track of you and possibly put you in a work camp/political detention facility.		</div>

It has a population of ~1.35 Million people<br /><br />Lyon is ~175 miles North of Mareille(~250 miles SSE of Paris), and 100 miles from the eastern extreme which appears to be the border area with Switzerland and Italy.

Strasbourg is also ~40 miles SSSW of the Easternmost etreme of France, and ~260 miles east of Paris.<br /><br />Moving west, <br /><br />We have Toulouse Sitting roughly halfway between the Med(95 miles) and the Bay of Biscay(Atlantic Ocean @ ~130 miles), ~60 mils from Spain, and ~200 miles west of Marseille.  Population ~761,000.<br /><br />Bordeaux is ~ 120 miles NW of Toulosuse, 30 miles from the Bay of Biscay, and ~130 miles from Spain.

In addition to that, it also shows &quot;Urban Clusters&quot; which are areas with urban population densities with more than 10,000 people. Which means there is far more red showing on that map than I want/need to make my point, but I&#39;ll take it as it&#39;s the best I can get at the moment.<br /><br />Edit to add: I chose France because it is decently sized and relatively well regarded(when it comes to health care). Great Britain is small enough I doubt any sane person is going to argue people don&#39;t live within a 100 miles of a major city/urban area. Likewise for a number of other smaller European Nations. The only other one you could try to pick nits on is Germany, but I&#39;m certain you&#39;d find what held for France holds true for Germany as well where population dispersal goes.		</div>

						That would be his point.  Rural in France is different from rural in America.  Thus, if you are saying rural populations in France are well served by centralized health care, it is hard to say if it will work as well for serving rural America.		</div>

So in order to bring ourselves up to the same level as the rest of the world, yeah, perhaps UHC is the only way.<br /><br />But it could never work HERE.  Because we suck compared to Malta, Italy, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">France</span>, Canada, Japan, Sweden, Norway...</div><br /><br />Also keep in mind that Japan is likewise highly urbanized to the point where I think it is impossible to find a &quot;small town&quot; that is more than 100 miles from a major city. Unless you&#39;re talking about small islands that are out in the middle of the Pacific(like Iwo Jima), but those instances contribute such a negligible amount to the general population to not even register in the noise level surveys of National Health Care systems would get in their statistical sample. (it should also be noted that France likewise retains control of a number of &quot;middle of nowhere islands&quot; as well, to much the same effect)<br /><br />Canada is likewise something of a poor example, while they do have some even more exceptionally rural areas, roughly 75% of their population lives within 150 miles of the US, and a comparable ratio live in &quot;urban areas&quot; so once again, with few exceptions, most of them appear to live within easy travel distance of a major population center. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Canada" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Canada</a><br /><br />Heck, from that, it looks like the three northernmost territories of Canada: Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon make up a combined 0.31% of the National Population. So They&#39;re exceptionally rural given the land areas involved. However, I also think you&#39;re going to be hard pressed to get much in advanced medical care up their either, but that going back to those people being below the &quot;noise level&quot; of most national surveys.<br /><br />Using that Wiki link, &quot;As of 2006, Canada&#39;s 13 largest cities (metro areas) have a combined population of 17,885,000&quot; (note: total estimated population for Canada in 2006 was 31,612,897 -- 56.6% of their population lives in just 13 Urban Centers... )<br /><br />Playing with a better apples to apples comparison from that page: &quot;Canada has 100 cities with 45,000 inhabitants or more for a combined population of 20,687,000&quot; (65.4% of the population) <br /><br />Back to the United States for a moment: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_urban_areas" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unite...tes_urban_areas</a><br /><br />484 &quot;Urban Areas&quot; in 2000 with a population greater than 45,000 people. My copy/paste and suming on a spreadsheet gives me 193,895,753 people in those 484 Urban areas. The 2000 Census gave the US a population of 281,421,906. Which works out to 68.9% of the population, so some argument can be made about the US being slightly more Urbanized on the raw statistics side of things.<br /><br />Except lets go back and play with that 56.6% of the population in 13 Urban Areas in Canada. 56.6% of the US population would be 159,284,799 people in the US in 2000. Consulting that table again, it takes 129 &quot;Urban Areas&quot; in the United States to reach that proportion of the population as of 2000 -- and the 120&#39;s and 130&#39;s in that list are cities with ~250,000 people in them.<br /><br />So Canada can manage 56.6% of their population by handling 13 urban areas. The US has to manage 129 Urban areas to do the same thing.<br /><br />Canada can manage 65% of their population by managing 100 areas. The US would be looking at 484 areas for the same general kind of spread, never mind dealing with the people in more rural areas -- that other third of the population. If you can&#39;t see several additional layers of bureaucracy appearing in a US version of National Health Care that doesn&#39;t exist in the Canadian one, you&#39;re on some mighty fine drugs. The size alone would pretty much mandate it, as the people who would be the final tier in the Canadian system would likely end up three or more rungs away from the top in the US system.<br /><br />...Which isn&#39;t to say the US system isn&#39;t horribly bloated and inefficient as it is, but yikes.		</div>

That&#39;s... a completely meaningless figure.  <br /><br />After all, our number is 81%.

Florida is the highest-premium state, with an average 2004 premium of more than &#36;195,000, followed by Nevada, Michigan, the District of Columbia, Ohio, Massachusetts, West Virginia, Connecticut, Illinois and New York.<br /><br />The 10 lowest-premium states are Oklahoma, at about &#36;17,000 on average, and Nebraska, South Dakota, Minnesota, Indiana, Idaho, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Arkansas and South Carolina.&quot;<br /><br />--Now keep in mind, the states of Nevade, Michigan, Washingto DC, Ohio, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Illinois, and New York have far more people in them than the 10 low cost states. To the point that some of them(New York) has more residents than most of those states combined. That is going to have a significant impact on what the cost of an ob/gyn visit is on the national level.<br /><br />but continuing with that article:<br /><br />&quot;Many areas of the country, especially around major metropolitan areas, are experiencing large increases in the average costs of premiums. Between 2003 and 2004, Dade County in Florida, which includes the city of Miami, went from &#36;249,000 to &#36;277,000, an increase of about 11 percent.<br /><br />In that same period, Cook County in Illinois, which includes Chicago, jumped about 67 percent from &#36;138,000 to more than &#36;230,000. Wayne County in Michigan, which includes Detroit, went up 18 percent, from almost &#36;164,000 to nearly &#36;194,000.&quot;<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/ric/ricpubs/RHNsprsum02.htm" target="_blank">http://www.nal.usda.gov/ric/ricpubs/RHNsprsum02.htm</a><br /><br />&quot;Citing data from a survey by Medical Liability Monitor, ACOG said that nationally, the median insurance premium for OB/GYNs increased 167 percent from 1982 to 1998. In 2000, it rose seven percent. In 2001, it went up another 12.5 percent. For 2002, the expected increase is 15 percent.<br /><br />According to American Medical News, eight states saw two or more liability insurers raise rates by at least 30 percent in 2001. In more than 12 states, one or more insurers raised rates by 25 percent or more.&quot;<br /><br />And before we go citing greed on the part of the Liability Insurance providers:<br /><br />&quot;In addition to the increases in premiums, some carriers are closing up shop. In December, 2001, The St. Paul Companies, the nation’s second-largest medical malpractice underwriter, insuring some 40,000 doctors in 45 states, announced that it would phase out of the business. The reason: it was losing too much money--&#36;1 billion in the last five years, according to CBS News. Other companies have also left the market or become insolvent.&quot;<br /><br />---Of course, going to state run health care could be fun for other reasons. As you&#39;re no longer suing the doctor persay. You&#39;re now suing the Government. Have fun with that. Though I guess one solution on that front is for the US Government to offer a &quot;Catastrophic insurance&quot; option to the medical insurance field like they already do for the Insurance Industry for floods and earthquakes.<br /><br />The other end of the Medical Liability thing is this: The doctors need to be insured, in the case of hospitals, the administrators have to be (additionally) insured as they&#39;re potentially liable for anything a doctor working under them does. The medical (electronic) equipment provider needs to have insurance on themselves as well. The pharmaceutical companies need to have insurance on themselves as well in case of unexpected side effects, and so forth.<br /><br /> 3) I served in the Military, I&#39;ve seen state run health care and experienced it first hand. Yes, its nice to not have to worry about the cost of care. But it also can be a very painful and exhausting undertaking getting them to do anything. It isn&#39;t all its cracked up to be. <br /><br />Going even further on that point, the United States Government frequently claims/asserts it cannot afford to provide the full range of medical benefits it already promised to its veterans. Which is why dealing with the VA for anything medical is a gigantic PITA, and you&#39;re thinking the country can afford to do it for everyone?<br /><br />4) First off, you seem to be under the assumption that I think full and unconditional access to Health Care should be a universal right. I don&#39;t think it is. <br />That being said, I do see common benefit by it being accessible and affordable, so I do view it as being an &quot;infrastructure&quot; item. Good health care systems are needed to reduce/prevent the impact of things like disease, and a healthy population is more likely to be a productive one.<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing the US Government stepping into/picking up the tab for some things. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Preventative</span> medicine items would be one such item, so a lot of the pre-natal stuff for pregnancies would potentially be covered, mammograms, colonosopies, and all that other fun stuff that doctors recommend for early detection of various cancers for example. (the earlier they&#39;re detected, the more likely it can be fought off successfully, and with much less cost) This could also potentially include the annual dental visit for a checkup/cleaning as well.<br /><br />Preventative Medicine is mentioned specifically because I know a number of insurance companies for various bizarre reasons don&#39;t seem to like footing the bill for that stuff.<br /><br />I also potentially wouldn&#39;t mind seeing minors(and potentially college/university students as well) getting a full coverage option c/o the US Government as I don&#39;t think they should be &quot;medically penalized&quot; due to the economic status of their parents.<br /><br />Of course, the &quot;fun&quot; part of my particular take on it is that I very much do not want to see the government dealing in many of the much more expensive medical procedures. I&#39;d let it get into it edgewise(like the early cancer detections), but don&#39;t think it should be involved in paying for, or determining a course of treatment once it has been detected, that should remain in the private sector IMO. Though that potentially results in the not-fully insured person getting the Government going &quot;Well, you&#39;ve got Cancer, and it&#39;s completely treatable right now, but since you lack any coverage to pay for the operation, you&#39;re pretty much fucked anyway as I doubt any carrier will insure you now.&quot;<br /><br />The biggest problem is where to draw the line on a lot of this stuff, and its the biggest reason I&#39;m more inclined to leave it the hands of private industry, and let the individual/family (in conjunction with the private sector) be the one that made the call that ultimately resulted in their final (medical) outcome. I have major issue with a national health care plan getting implemented where the United States Government has just committed itself to potentially spending hundreds of thousands of dollars helping some 60 YO male fight off some rare form of cancer just because he happens to be an American.<br /><br />I can see how that person&#39;s family potentially benefits from the government picking up the tab on that, but I fail to see how the nation benefits from doing so. If the nation does benefit in such a case, chances are extremely good he was in a position where he could have funded it himself if a private option was still available. <br /><br />I know I&#39;m being a total and complete asshole for saying this but it is true: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is not, and never has been, the mandate of the United States Government to provide &quot;warm fuzzies&quot; for its citizens</span>, if private industry wants to do so, more power to them, but that is not a role the Government should be funding. The biggest problem with Universal Health Care if provided for by the United States Government, is that there will be numerous occasions where it will be doing just that: providing warm fuzzies, and little else.		</div>

Current reports about the quality of VA care are pretty great.  With the exception of the psychological side of things, which the military pretty much pretends doesn&#39;t exist.  Most complaints about wait times and crap like that date back to at least the 90&#39;s, before VA records were centralized, reducing cost overhead and raising efficiency.  Second link is an abstract.  Key point:<br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">This comparison of care in two different health care systems, VA and non-VA, indicates that the VA system is more efficient. Non-VA settings might be able to reduce the amount of certain types of care provided, such as emergency department and home health visits, without impairing outcomes.</div><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/NPDB_Report_200907.pdf" target="_blank">On Malpractice.</a><br />That&#39;s fantastic. But &#36;75-&#36;125k means nothing in a bubble. The cost of malpractice insurance premiums account for <b>less than one half of one percent</b> of total healthcare costs. So even if malpractice suits were banned completely (and your OB/GYN could deliver a child, snap its spine in twain and then cut the mother&#39;s legs off and leave her with no legal recourse) it still wouldn&#39;t fix shit as far as costs are concerned.<br /><br />I&#39;m tired of &quot;free&quot; market worship.  Health Care is left to the free market in somalia, along with damn near everything else.  And that place is a fuckin&#39; bastion of free-rolling consumerism and and a burgeoning economic powerhouse...  Or something.<br /><br />Take everything off the alter.  Nothing&#39;s sacred.  Examine the situation with health care objectively.  Learn lessons from people who have tried and succeeded/failed before us.<br /><br />Please explain your final statement, as I&#39;m curious as to what you mean by &quot;warm-fuzzies&quot; if not &quot;health care&quot;, in which case your &quot;little else&quot; aside makes about as much sense as a rooster&#39;s tooth.<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE (Alfy &#64; Jul 27 2009, 01&#58;40 PM) <a rel="nofollow" href="index.php?act=findpost&amp;pid=18510">&lt;{POST_SNAPBACK}&gt;</a></div><div class="quotemain">Perhaps maybe it could be an opt in program?

(The top 40% would be anyone with a household, before tax, income of more than &#36;62,153/year as of December 31, 2007)<br /><br />After all, do you really think that the bottom 20% of household income earners(tops out at &#36;20,752 /year before taxes), is going to be able to afford paying a tax rate that would be able to cover their own share of the medical expenses? And keep in mind, it is that bottom 20% in particular that is most likely to be picking up any Government Health Insurance plan.<br /><br />This is a &quot;social justice&quot; ie: &quot;social welfare&quot; / social engineering undertaking. It means income redistribution will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have to</span> occur, so that the end result is that rich are paying for the benefits the poor are receiving. Which is something governments are awesome at, they aren&#39;t concerned about profit margins when it comes to rendering services to a person. Heck, as we&#39;ve seen, Governments can also be very practiced at not having to worry about solvency either(lol stimulus, lol California, lol the past 70 some-odd years). <br /><br />But basically, they cannot allow paying for this program to be &quot;opt in&quot; because if they do, it would never be anything resembling solvent, as they want to make at least some pretense of &quot;money out = money in&quot; and if the guys at the bottom can&#39;t pay, the guys at the top will make up the difference.<br /><br />Which isn&#39;t to mention the several million people in the US who are willfully uninsured. Something about deciding that rather than pay a &#36;600/month health insurance premium, they decided to buy some Recreational Vehicles or a House that is considerably larger/nicer than they actually needed.		</div>

Current reports about the quality of VA care are pretty great.  With the exception of the psychological side of things, which the military pretty much pretends doesn&#39;t exist.  Most complaints about wait times and crap like that date back to at least the 90&#39;s, before VA records were centralized, reducing cost overhead and raising efficiency.</div><br /><br />Active duty from June 1999 until June 2007. VA wait times are still a joke, Active Duty military still does anything and everything they can to avoid documenting things that lead to a &quot;service connected disability&quot; claim down the line. Typically the guys that get the biggest run around on that are the ones who&#39;d basically be going for what would be a workman&#39;s comp type accident/injury in the course of doing their job. However, there are plenty of reports of them trying to pull comparable stunts on people who can trace their issue to stuff that happened on the actual Battlefield.<br /><br />Then you get off of Active Duty and get to demonstrate to the VA that yes that disability still exists(in some cases even having to recertify it -- like a 80% hearing loss is going to suddenly correct itself). However, I can&#39;t speak too authoritatively on the VA disability side as I don&#39;t currently have any(mildy concerned about Mesothelioma cropping up later in life as I was potentially exposed to asbestos while on Active Duty, but I&#39;ll cross that bridge when/if I get there), so what I do have there is second/third hand. They&#39;re better than they used to be, but they&#39;re still terrible. Getting my GI Bill benefits was enough of an adventure -- taking just shy of 3 months to get it turned on. However, I do know of a few people who had service related problems that have had to go to third parties (American Legion/VFW/Congressmen) and get them to start asking questions before anything started getting done for them.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Second link is an abstract.  Key point:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/NPDB_Report_200907.pdf" target="_blank">On Malpractice.</a><br />That&#39;s fantastic. But &#36;75-&#36;125k means nothing in a bubble. The cost of malpractice insurance premiums account for <b>less than one half of one percent</b> of total healthcare costs. So even if malpractice suits were banned completely (and your OB/GYN could deliver a child, snap its spine in twain and then cut the mother&#39;s legs off and leave her with no legal recourse) it still wouldn&#39;t fix shit as far as costs are concerned.<br /><br />I&#39;m tired of &quot;free&quot; market worship.  Health Care is left to the free market in somalia, along with damn near everything else.  And that place is a fuckin&#39; bastion of free-rolling consumerism and and a burgeoning economic powerhouse...  Or something.<br /><br />Take everything off the alter.  Nothing&#39;s sacred.  Examine the situation with health care objectively.  Learn lessons from people who have tried and succeeded/failed before us.</div><br /><br />The legal protection in those highest cost areas is probably a bigger expense for the doctor than the facilities he is using. Which is a little worrisome in my book, but to each their own.<br /><br />Other factors at play: Cost of education (though the incidently also blame some of their own price hikes on the rising cost of health care)<br /><br />Hospital costs incurred when caring for patients that cannot afford the care they are receiving -- this is perhaps the biggest contributor. In this particular case, getting them on some kind of insurance/care plan would help as hospitals are no longer charging the people who can pay high rates because others can&#39;t pay(which creates its own feedback).<br /><br />As far as costs of drugs are concerned, no National Health Care plan is going to be able to address that. Highly specialized drugs take a lot of highly specialized research, and have very lengthy vetting processes(that still aren&#39;t perfect) that incur very large amounts of expenses. Being corporate entities, they&#39;re in the business of making money(profits) on a regular basis, and that means recovering their costs in a timely manner, another thing not helping them there is patent law currently only gives them a small window of opportunity to enjoy exclusivity on the drug before the generics can come in and drop the price to near cost of production. Which means they have less than 20 years(often times much less, as the clock starts ticking once they file for the patent on the compounds involved... Which will often be well before it starts going through the FDA approval process, to make sure someone else doesn&#39;t patent it in the mean time) to recover the hundreds of millions(if not billion+) they spent developing that latest life saving/changing wonder drug. <br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Please explain your final statement, as I&#39;m curious as to what you mean by &quot;warm-fuzzies&quot; if not &quot;health care&quot;, in which case your &quot;little else&quot; aside makes about as much sense as a rooster&#39;s tooth.</div><br /><br />A &quot;warm fuzzy&quot; in this case is something that provides little/no discernible benefit to society as a whole, other than making people feel good about what was accomplished. Like spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to help a retired 77 YO male (named &quot;Bob&quot;) with Liver Cancer fight it off so he can live to be 84 and get another ~6 years of life with his children/grandchildren/great-grandchildren.  <br /><br />While the warm fuzzy of knowing I helped Bob live see his latest great-grandchild born when he is 82 years old, and that his family probably considered the experience to be priceless.... I&#39;m not sure I consider it be an effective use of the tax payer&#39;s money. Of course, we have medicaid and medicare that already help to some degree in cases like Bob.  It&#39;s cruel, it&#39;s heartless, but I&#39;m sorry, his extra few years of life better have left one hell of a profound impact on his great-grandchildren, or I think we would have been further ahead building bridges in Death Valley for all the benefit society got for their money on that.<br /><br />Now if a private insurance company had said they were willing to take the risk of him getting cancer at age 77, and would cover his costs should he get it, more power to that insurance company when it turns out Bob does get cancer at 77. <br /><br />However don&#39;t tell me that society is obligated to keep him alive simply because we can do it. There are a lot of things we could do if we wanted to, it doesn&#39;t mean we have to do so, or that we should do so. (That goes for things we can do for good, and for ill for those who can&#39;t figure that out)<br /><br />And like Social Security(something else I generally disagree with, as I think Adults should be held responsible for the planing of their own well being not some nanny state, but that started more than 40 years before I was born so its moot), once we make the commitment to do something &quot;for the people of the United States,&quot; we are committed to doing it. So make damned sure you know what you(we) are promising to each other and everyone else when it is made, because you&#39;re going to be very hard pressed getting out of it once committed. I know this is one commitment I for one do NOT want to be making as I do not like the obligations that are going to follow as a result. Which isn&#39;t to mention the other things it is going to do, as I&#39;m fairly certain that the plan before congress will ultimately result in the death of private insurance for anyone except the really wealthy(top 5 to 10% of society).		</div>

						Stats about who does and does not have insurance are kind of difficult to analyze.  It&#39;s like asking who does and does not own a home.  There are many reasons somebody making 75k would not own a home.  Perhaps they have a poor credit score and can&#39;t secure a loan, perhaps they can&#39;t find a house to buy near where they work so they rent, maybe they prefer to rent.  Who knows.<br /><br />There are too many factors related to why somebody may or may not have insurance at that level of income.<br /><br />What&#39;s clear is that our of the employed, an average of 70% get health insurance.  Among the highest earners, or those who could afford it themselves, 90% received employer health insurance.  Among the lowest 10% of earners however, that number drops to <span>25%</span><br /><br />In other words, those who need it most, are denied it.  And those who are the Titans of industry, the earners, the movers, the shakers, aren&#39;t also forced to go out and pick themselves up by their boot straps.  They are protected by the power of collective bargaining.  Seems like a dick move to me to exclude poor people just because they are poor.		</div>

						The Healthcare Bill would create some 5 person commission that decides what kind of operations/medicines to approve and would probably give that commission authority to pass regulations such as if you have X number of quality life years left and the treatment costs over Y per quality life year left then you don&#39;t get the treatment.  Because it is a law in the Code of Federal Regulations it would be impossible to sue the government (saying they should have granted the treatment bc the law says they did not have to) unless you are trying to claim the law is unconstitutional which would make the suing process pretty insurmountable.  (although we are moving toward viewing health care as a right so maybe some day it will be a constitutional right such that a law denying it would be unconstitutional). <br /><br />And I really do not feel like doing research into US-based drugs since most people would admit we lead the world in research, so you can believe what you want (that sure we lead the world in research but it is not useful research bc it is designed to make money off of weird ass drugs).		</div>

Somebody had to pay for it, and for the code to run it.  They will recoup the loss by charging as much as they can recoup through insurance (prices and rates are negotiated, if I remember my Siemens days well enough) and then passing the cost onto everybody who pays into the system.  This could easily be the biggest cost to health care in this country.  It&#39;s certainly not malpractice insurance.<br /><br />There wasn&#39;t more to the story.  The doctor told him there was a slight chance that he could have a tumor, and that they could either try an antibiotic for a week and see, or take an MRI later that week and find out that way.  He got the MRI because it&#39;s 15 bucks, and now he has a CD-ROM with a 3D picture of his dome on it.  Other payers into his insurance plan picked up the remaining 2 grand or so.		</div>

That prohibition is the closest thing you have to the US having a law on the books giving everyone a right at the expense of another segment of the population(freedom of the press being mildly grey on that front in the last century).<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">When we created a minimum wage granting labor rights to workers, we &quot;suppressed&quot; the rights of business owners to hire who they liked and pay them what they wanted...</div><br /><br />First off: Closed Shop laws should be considered illegal and overturned wherever they remain(sadly I know that is never going to happen). Closed Shop laws are not simply removing choice on the part of the employer, but on the part of their employees as well in many cases where it is practiced. Thankfully, the state I currently live in is &quot;Right to Work&quot; so it&#39;s moot for me anyhow as Closed Shop is a non-issue for anyone who isn&#39;t a union booster around here. (I do support collective bargaining, which Unions in theory help achieve. I simply don&#39;t support &quot;collective bargaining&quot; where many of the people involved are part of that &quot;collective&quot; because they were coerced into it)<br /><br />Minimum wage laws, while potentially grounds for claiming a suppression of &quot;business rights&quot; is not a suppression of individual rights or in particular individual liberties. The only people who could come close to making that claim are the people who are truly cut loose or never hired simply because an employer couldn&#39;t afford to pay minimum wage to keep/bring them on while having everyone else on their payroll. <br /><br />Which isn&#39;t to say there is a world of difference between &quot;everyone <span style="text-decoration: underline;">who is employed</span> should be paid(or has a right to) a wage of at least ____ per hour.&quot; and saying &quot;everyone has a right to health care no matter the cost.&quot; An employer can choose to simply not employee any more people. A health care provider would still be obligated to render services, which hospitals already are obligated to do in some respects already, they already are legally incapable of allowing someone to bleed to death on their doorstep as it is.<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Daemon, you might be the most intellectually inconsistent person I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure of speaking with on the internet, and I frankly don&#39;t even know where to begin replying to your tome of a post.<br /><br />You clearly think that poor people are a burden on society, and should be treated accordingly. Ok.</div><br /><br />It&#39;s a complex issue, and it is a hard one to put down in any substantive form without missing a whole lot pieces and parts. If it was easy issue to address it would have been handled long since.<br /><br />1. Poor people in and of themselves are not necessarily a burden, people have to start out somewhere. I have nothing against providing assistance to people <span style="text-decoration: underline;">who are trying to be productive</span> members of society. I&#39;ve had the occasion to know people in this category, and they are amazing people, and with few exceptions, they get rewarded for it. (they cease being poor)<br /><br />2. Not every poor person is productive, and I&#39;ve known more than my share of people who feel they are entitled to everything under the sun while having done virtually nothing to deserve anything.<br /><br />3. It is virtually impossible to create a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">large scale</span> system that will be able to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">effectively</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">efficiently</span> distinguish between the two.<br /><br />4. Likewise, it is virtually impossible to create a system to address that which doesn&#39;t end up with either <br />A) Significant Corruption <br />or <br /><img src="src" alt="image" />/cool.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid="B)" border="0" alt="cool.gif" /&gt; Significant Bureaucracy making it unresponsive... (back to point #3)<br />and<br />C) If it doesn&#39;t end up with both. <br /><br />That isn&#39;t to say it can&#39;t be done, just that it is very easy to create a system that won&#39;t work. <br /><br />(Points 3 and 4 are why the scale of the undertaking in front of the US was a point I brought up when compared to other nations. They&#39;re smaller in geography, population, and had some geographic advantages for the most part that the US lacks in many cases)<br /><br />5. I believe in stupid being rewarded for being stupid, and am not a big fan of &quot;safety nets for stupid.&quot; Particularly when those safety nets come at the expense of people who would otherwise want nothing to do with said individuals and their stupidity. If someone decides health insurance isn&#39;t a bigger priority in their life than the nicer things, I&#39;m not sure why the United States Government should provide it for them. I guess you could say I&#39;m fan of allowing for natural selection to occur.<br /><br />6. I also understand that &quot;basic level&quot; healtcare services to the population at large are critical to well being of everyone, and the economic productivity of the nation. <br /><br />We don&#39;t want communicable diseases to spread anymore than can be helped. <br />We don&#39;t wan&#39;t a nation of people who are crippled because they couldn&#39;t get a medical professional to properly set their broken bones.<br />We don&#39;t want people getting killed by infected wounds(which isn&#39;t to mention health concerns over whatever they may have oozed upon in the mean time). <br /><br />I don&#39;t want to see people die a needlessly painful death because they cannot afford painkillers. (Why I would support hospice level health care. While I may be harsh enough to practically condemn them to death, that doesn&#39;t mean I want it to be a needlessly painful experience for them)<br /><br />I would like to give people the best chance possible of surviving any disease that can be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">easily treated</span>. (if detected in time -- which is why I would support preventative medicine, also bearing in mind that for healthy people, preventative medicine checks are the most expensive line-item carried by health insurance companies -- it significantly lowers their overhead, which should in turn make &quot;catastrophic insurance&quot; for things like cancer, much more affordable for everyone... as even the cost of treating most forms of cancer should in turn be lower thanks to it being caught much earlier)<br /><br />I would like to make sure that nobody is unduly penalized as a result of who their parents are, as they had little/no choice in that matter. (Which is why I would be fine with the somewhat contradictory stance that I would have no problem with the Government covering minors and potentially college/university students as well)<br /><br />I could go on but you&#39;ve already complained about the walls of text as it is.		</div>

						1. So then what &quot;right&quot; of health care providers as specifically enumerated (since that&#39;s the criteria you&#39;re using above) is being infringed by the idea of UHC?<br /><br />2. This IS very hard.  And there are lessons to be learned from other countries.  But you, and tons of people like you, simply block those lessons out by saying we can&#39;t do it here.  I say that&#39;s a shitty attitude.<br /><br />3. You don&#39;t seem to recognize the problem.  There already IS a &quot;safety net for stupid&quot;.  Shit, YOU even pointed it out.  Any asshole can go into any hospital and they can&#39;t turn him away.  Our safety net is just pointlessly expensive and inefficient already.  But you don&#39;t want to rush into a solution that might be... expensive... or inefficient.  And then you enumerated reasons why we NEED to provide this safety net.  Their stupidity harms us all.  Think AIDS in Africa.  They are dumb for not wearing protection and screwing virgins to &quot;cure&quot; their AIDS...  &quot;Natural Selection&quot; will eventually wipe out most of the continent.  This isn&#39;t just bad for Africa, but potentially bad for the world.<br /><br />4. You seem to want UHC, but you don&#39;t want to call it UHC, and you want to be the personal arbiter of who does and does not get what care.  Sorry, you don&#39;t get to.  What&#39;s the point of providing care to everybody if people with AIDS or Cancer can&#39;t get treatment with it?  &quot;Take this Tylenol (that is still overpriced) and don&#39;t bother calling, cause I got more important shit to do for this guy with money.&quot; is not helpful.<br /><br />5. When you make a claim.  Fucking cite it.  Jesus.  How hard is this?  You read it or heard it somewhere.  Just tell me where or I&#39;m going to assume you&#39;re pulling numbers and facts straight out of your butthole.<br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">also bearing in mind that for healthy people, preventative medicine checks are the <b>most expensive line-item carried by health insurance companies</b> -- <b>it significantly lowers their overhead</b>, which should in turn make &quot;catastrophic insurance&quot; for things like cancer, much more affordable for everyone... as even the cost of treating most forms of cancer should in turn be lower thanks to it being <b>caught much earlier</b></div><br />- How expensive, and how much more expensive than other costs?<br />- How does it lower their overhead if it&#39;s more expensive?  Do you know what &quot;overhead&quot; refers to?<br />- Please show that people who have insurance that covers preventative care and regular checkups have fewer incidences of Stage III or IV cancers than those without.  I believe it because it&#39;s logical.  But that doesn&#39;t make it fact.<br /><br />I agree that preventative care is really important.  But I also believe that it&#39;s a lower cost item than catastrophic or continued care.

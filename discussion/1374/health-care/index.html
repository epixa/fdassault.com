						First, Andrew, by reducing overhead for doctors offices, you do know that means cutting tens of thousands of jobs, right? If there&#39;s no need for employees, there wont be a demand for them.<br /><br />Onto a different note:<br /><br />Why should I keep paying for things I wont use? I willingly give tons of money to charity. I already pay for roads, bridges, tunnels, tolls and the military. Which I will never complain about. But please do explain to me why the role of the government now more than ever is determined to put its hands on things that aren&#39;t involved in its foundation? What is stopping me from setting up a corporation overseas and just living in America? If I&#39;m going to get taxed at ridiculously high rates for things I horribly disagree with, what&#39;s stopping me from moving my income stream beyond US borders? This could potentially be a horrible situation for America.<br /><br />Also, who says health care is a natural born right? Why shouldn&#39;t I get the better doctor, better care, if I can afford to pay more? Why shouldn&#39;t the best doctor in the world have a right to charge exorbitant rates? The best baseball players get paid much more than the league minimum. This is, remember, the American way. The end goal is to be the best, to have whatever it is you want. Maybe it&#39;s a prestigious academic position, the Fields Medal, or maybe it&#39;s having a boatload of money. The world needs ditch diggers and gas station pumpers, just as they need the wealthy who already pay so much more than the poor for things they&#39;ll never need. If you try to tell me, after I pay for your education, pay for part of your meals, pay for your new car, your first home that I don&#39;t deserve priority over the things that I can actually afford there&#39;s something horribly distorted with your idea of how capitalism and the economy work.<br />		</div>

That&#39;s not even a conservative philosophy; I&#39;m not really sure what type of philosophy that is.<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE (mungo &#64; Aug 4 2009, 09&#58;58 AM) <a rel="nofollow" href="index.php?act=findpost&amp;pid=18665">&lt;{POST_SNAPBACK}&gt;</a></div><div class="quotemain">Why should I keep paying for things I wont use? I willingly give tons of money to charity. I already pay for roads, bridges, tunnels, tolls and the military. Which I will never complain about. But please do explain to me why the role of the government now more than ever is determined to put its hands on things that aren&#39;t involved in its foundation? What is stopping me from setting up a corporation overseas and just living in America? If I&#39;m going to get taxed at ridiculously high rates for things I horribly disagree with, what&#39;s stopping me from moving my income stream beyond US borders? This could potentially be a horrible situation for America.</div><br /><br />It is my understanding that US citizens are taxed regardless of where they do business, so if you decided to live in the US and run a company overseas, your income would still be subject to US tax law.<br /><br />All of that is pretty much a moot point though since the scenario you outline is not at all inline with historical precedent.  Our country didn&#39;t collapse under the weight of far higher taxes on the rich in past decades.  Not only that, but we will be one of the last westernized countries to adopt anything that could resemble universal health care (which is a pretty big stretch given the current state of the health care bills in congress), so it&#39;s not like they are going to flee to some other privileged nation where they won&#39;t be taxed at &quot;ridiculously high rates.&quot;<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE (mungo &#64; Aug 4 2009, 09&#58;58 AM) <a rel="nofollow" href="index.php?act=findpost&amp;pid=18665">&lt;{POST_SNAPBACK}&gt;</a></div><div class="quotemain">Also, who says health care is a natural born right? Why shouldn&#39;t I get the better doctor, better care, if I can afford to pay more? Why shouldn&#39;t the best doctor in the world have a right to charge exorbitant rates? The best baseball players get paid much more than the league minimum. This is, remember, the American way. The end goal is to be the best, to have whatever it is you want. Maybe it&#39;s a prestigious academic position, the Fields Medal, or maybe it&#39;s having a boatload of money. The world needs ditch diggers and gas station pumpers, just as they need the wealthy who already pay so much more than the poor for things they&#39;ll never need. If you try to tell me, after I pay for your education, pay for part of your meals, pay for your new car, your first home that I don&#39;t deserve priority over the things that I can actually afford there&#39;s something horribly distorted with your idea of how capitalism and the economy work.</div><br /><br />I agree.  While we are at it, let&#39;s get rid of the following socialized, government funded/managed departments and organizations so we can apply this same philosophy across the board:<br /><br />    * Police<br />    * Firefighters<br />    * Federal Emergency Management Agency<br />    * Food and Drug Administration<br />    * Federal Highway Administration<br />    * Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration<br />    * Department of Agriculture<br />    * Department of Commerce<br />    * Department of Defense<br />    * Department of Education<br />    * Department of Energy<br />    * Department of Health and Human Services<br />    * Department of Homeland Security<br />    * Department of Housing and Urban Development<br />    * Department of Justice<br />    * Department of Labor<br />    * Department of State<br />    * Department of the Interior<br />    * Department of Transportation<br />    * Department of Veterans Affairs<br /><br />If you agree with that, then great&#33;  I&#39;m glad to have you on board this sinking conservative ship.  Otherwise, don&#39;t mascaraed as a conservative unless you have the balls to not nitpick which issues you want to be conservative about.  You are dealing with perhaps the biggest class-struggle in the US since the separate-but-equal laws, and you have the audacity to say that the lives of the poor aren&#39;t worth your dime (which is disgusting), and you do so under a faux-conservative banner (which is insulting).		</div>

Just how inconsistent.  And seemingly arbitrary.<br /><br />But I don&#39;t think that list was meant to talk about things the fed gov&#39;t should/shouldn&#39;t do, but rather a list of services that people who fancy themselves completely independent of government support invariably use without taking a second thought.<br /><br />There are no federal fire fighters, for example.  But if your house is on fire, and you call the FD, then you&#39;re using taxpayer money to bail yourself out of a pickle, and if you&#39;ve got a shitty apartment in NE Philly, the benefits of this service are spread across everybody in the apartment complex, and the value of the property is fairly low, and if lost, would not represent a tremendous financial hit on the denizens.  If you&#39;ve got a 5 million dollar mansion in California, and you use the FD, then you are using that money to save only yourself and your belongings, which total in value to more than the entire block of apartments mentioned earlier.<br /><br />Oh and if you don&#39;t call the FD, then you have to use water from your personal well.  Taxpayer money paid for that water system.  And whatever you do, don&#39;t drive on the roads, or now even buy an American car (that isn&#39;t a Ford).  Don&#39;t buy organic produce, and research which fruits and vegetables you buy.  You wouldn&#39;t want to buy something that might have been subsidized by taxpayers...		</div>

						We spend 7% of GDP on defense, 22% on healthcare. We cannot afford free (or extraordinarily cheap) healthcare.

There are far better ways to improve the &#39;health of the country&#39; than expanding medical coverage and tying it into yet another layer of beuracracy.

						I think Richie&#39;s point is that there are lots of countries with successful UHC programs, so while comparing the details of one program to another might not be very useful, it isn&#39;t really fair to say that the success of such programs doesn&#39;t support the idea that a form of universal healthcare could be successful here as well.<br /><br />As for that statistic I brought up, I was simply pointing out that statistics do exist for citation.

						I guess your version of successfully working is different then mine, because simply getting by doesn&#39;t really cut it.<br /><br />Lets look at the biggest socialized group of people in the US; the military.  If healthcare is run like anything else in the military, including its own healthcare program, it would be a giant failure.  It simply wouldn&#39;t work.

						I can tell you from personal experience from myself and from some of my colleagues, the military&#39;s healthcare is anything but run &quot;pretty well&quot;.  <br /><br />Between ridiculously heavy paperwork and bureaucratic backlogs, long wait times, inadequately trained medical personnel, a shortage of doctors, and old, sometimes not working equipment it leaves a lot to be desired.  I can definitely go to a private practitioner, and have done so in the past because my career was in jeopardy otherwise, and receive better, quicker service.  That may be practical for myself, but it isn&#39;t for a good portion of the enlisted people who&#39;s salary won&#39;t let them do so.  <br /><br />I&#39;ve heard similar claims from retired military and VAs that TheDaemon claimed.		</div>

Also just how and when &quot;live births&quot; are reported from nation to nation skews the outcome.<br /><br />The second largest employer in the world is the UK&#39;s Health Care administration, this does not include the doctors&#33;<br /><br />And the main reason we can not go down the path of socialized medicine: We can not afford it, we are broke, in debt beyond reason, and the people we owe the money to are worse than the mafia&#33;<br /><br />		</div>

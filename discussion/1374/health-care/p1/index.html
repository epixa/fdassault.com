						I&#39;m totally fine with universal health care in nearly any form.  In fact, I welcome it&#33;  Just provide it on the state level, so I can leave if I do not approve, or at least I can exercise more of an influence over the decisions of how it should be funded and in what ways it should operate.<br /><br />I absolutely do not support it on the federal level in any way, shape, or form.		</div>

						State Run UHC would really fuck places in certain states.  That&#39;s the only problem I see with that approach in this particular scenario.  Typically though, you&#39;re absolutely right.<br /><br />Think about CA.  Tons of illegals who will get care, and a couple big ass cities with an abundance of poor people, and they are already experiencing a budget shortfall, and have been for quite some time.  I don&#39;t think they could shoulder the burden there.<br /><br />Perhaps a State Run solution with Federal support might be a workable approach, but idk.<br /><br />We need this desperately though.		</div>

						Californians need to make a choice about what is important to them.  If universal healthcare is important to the entire state, then they would be willing to spend the money necessary to make it work (which would probably involve fixing a few of the other problems the state faces first).  However, California is extremely large and some may be more willing to shoulder the burden to get universal health care going than others.  In that case, more local governments can step in.  I believe San Francisco already has similar plans on the books?<br /><br />Regardless, I don&#39;t live in California, so I don&#39;t want a single penny of my paycheck being spent on their healthcare system.  If I did want to give money to California so that they could subsidize their grandiose healthcare plans so that their out-of-control illegal immigration problem doesn&#39;t fuck with their desire not to fall behind the rest of the country, then I will do so personally.  But just so we&#39;re clear, I don&#39;t.<br /><br />I don&#39;t like the state of healthcare in PA.  I think it could grow leaps and bounds.  I think it <i>would</i> grow leaps and bounds if my fellow citizens stopped expecting the rest of the country to pay for issues that do not and should not concern them.		</div>

						Even though this is less about my opinion of health care, it is on the topic of healthcare:<br /><br />I think the democrats are starting to pull a brilliant strategy when it comes to a public healthcare option.  I don&#39;t know if it is intentional (I assume it is), but more and more I hear democrats saying &quot;the health care industry isn&#39;t competitive enough, so a public option will really apply competitive pressure, which will increase the quality of healthcare all around.&quot;  That&#39;s very capitalistic of them, which will appeal to a much larger population than the traditional &quot;the health care industry is awful, we need to step in and fix it.&quot;  I don&#39;t really know why they didn&#39;t pursue this line of promotion earlier...		</div>

						More like, if it&#39;s not an enumerated federal power then they should stfu and gbtw.<br /><br />However I don&#39;t suspect the complexities of our time were really within the scope of that particular document.  As wonderful as it is.<br /><br />Fact is, we&#39;re not only buttfucking poor people and sick people, we&#39;re buttfucking ourselves for still having to pay for them.  Meanwhile the insurance industry should be shut down and anyone involved in the top 10% of management of all the companies should be burned at the stake.  I think that would probably help.<br /><br />Adding beancounters to healthcare was the single gravest mistake we could have ever made in regards to the long term welfare of our citizenry.		</div>

						I think the complexities of our time have really helped to identify exactly how ageless the document is.  I truly believe the only reason the constitution appears so outdated is that people have absolutely no fucking idea why this country exists and what ideals it was founded to promote.  I don&#39;t really know why people think giving states power over their own affairs is worse than trying to get 300 million people on the same page on issues that affect every area dramatically different than other areas.<br /><br />If you want socialism, move to a socialist country.  Socialism is totally fine in my book, but the <i>only</i> thing that makes the US great is its ideals, and socialism is not one of them.<br /><br />If you want a strong federal government, then move to a country with a strong federal government.  Strong federal governments can do a lot of good for their people, but this country exists so that the people could have complete control over every single aspect of their lives so long as they don&#39;t interfere with the rights of other people.  A strong federal government, no matter how perfect it is, cannot abide by that principle.<br /><br />If you want to live in a dictatorship, go live in a dictatorship.  A dictatorship is easily the most efficient and effective government-types possible, so it has potential to do the most good for its citizens.  But that isn&#39;t the US.<br /><br />etc, etc.<br /><br />America is what it is; stop fucking it up with your compromises and appeals to the common good.		</div>

						What happens to states that can&#39;t produce goods or services?

						Yes, you hit my response to the &quot;cannot produce goods&quot; question square on the head.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think the modern landscape has shown the constitution to be great, I think it has shown just how viable the constitution could be if US citizens just realized why it and this country exist.  We have failed to abide by the constitution, so the failure is purely our own and not of the constitution itself.<br /><br />Irrational, selfish, and ignorant politicians are the consequence of US citizens ignoring the constitution for the sake of federal pragmatism.  The politicians aren&#39;t the problem itself, so I hardly blame them for being inept.  No, the problem is us, the US population.  The problem is that idealists like me are too cowardly to pick up arms, pragmatists like you are too accepting of truly devastating compromise, and far too many others are simply ignorant of the core values of this nation.<br /><br />To clarify: I&#39;m not an idealist on all fronts.  I am 100% for pragmatic approaches to constitutional issues.  I&#39;m fine with states compromising on their health care plans; I&#39;m fine with states compromising on their education plans; I&#39;m fine with states compromising on their defense budgets.  I am only an idealist when it comes to the extraordinarily simply, yet infinitely important confines of the constitution.  The reason I&#39;m idealistic in that one particular view is that the <i>slightest</i> compromise on <i>any</i> part of the constitution <i>will</i> lead [and is leading] to the complete breakdown of the entire foundation of this country.  At that point, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll all carry on as usual, but none of us will be worthy of the country&#39;s namesake, and the beautiful and righteous experiment that grew the greatest country in the history of human civilization will be a complete failure.		</div>

						Hey man, you think what you wanna think, but that&#39;s completely impractical to an extreme.  50 sets of regulations on goods transported between states?  No way.  There has to be consistency in some of our policies when the health of our population is on the line.<br /><br />I suppose the meatpacking plants would have more freedom under your model though.  And the pharmaceutical companies could all move to WV where there are no regulations in place preventing them from putting manure in their pills or forcing them to inform you of that ingredient.<br /><br />Another more modern example is credit companies who are about 30% responsible for this recession if you ask me.  All the intelligent state by state regulation of the industry adds up to exactly squat when credit companies can just go to Delaware and exercise their freedom to fuck us with shoddy contracts and high risk loans.  But that doesn&#39;t deal directly with people&#39;s health.  What credit companies do is wrong, what insurance companies do is extortion.		</div>

						Who says that 50 different regulatory agencies must have 50 different sets of regulations?  When universal access is of cost-benefit (which interstate food processing would fall into), standards arise that are adopted by most involved in the industry.  Look at the web as an example.  In less than two decades since it was created, universal standards are widely accepted for how to design and develop all sorts of code and even how to present material to users.  That is without <i>any</i> authority to force the standard upon anyone.  And believe me, there are tons of corporate interests, from some of the largest organizations on the planet, that would <i>love</i> to ignore the standards and push their own proprietary stuff into the market.  But then people wouldn&#39;t use their shit.<br /><br />The exact same principle can be applied to the meatpacking industry (since that is the example you brought up).  There is no reason why people can&#39;t come together to develop standards for this sort of thing, and if organizations aren&#39;t willing to adopt them voluntarily, a local regulatory committee can restrict the imports (or local production) based on the standard.  This only seems impossible now because all of our regulations exist on a highly centralized, non-republican federal government with no local influence at all.<br /><br />So the community in central PA is upset with the quality of meat products being imported from New Mexico?  Too fucking bad; the meat industry simply throws money at the &quot;problem&quot; and while 2 of the senators from your state might actually give a shit, the other 98 don&#39;t have any reason to care about your community&#39;s concerns.<br /><br />There is no substantial state-by-state regulation of the banking industry because the federal government is charged with handling it.  PA doesn&#39;t have the authority to say &quot;this bank is being unethical and shitty, so they&#39;re not allowed to do business in our state&quot; because it is federal jurisdiction <i>and</i> currently assumed federal responsibility.  The people literally have no fucking control over any of this <i>exclusively</i> because of the federal government you deem necessary to protect us from all of the horrible shit that it keeps failing to stop from happening.<br /><br />If Delaware wants to engage in bad banking practices, good for them.  If the entirety of the US wants to still utilize Delaware&#39;s shitty credit market, then good for them.  The economy will grow, the bubble will pop, and we will be in a horrible recession where the working man gets fucked over and over again.  No federal regulations would stop that from happening since the entire country was totally fine with the bad practices going on.  The difference between my scenario and yours is that in mine states would at least be able to exercise a greater influence over their own regulation to help protect their own population.<br /><br />What credit card and insurance companies do is exactly what they can be expected to have done and to continue to do.  They exist to make money, and they make quite a lot of it.  It is easier for them to control a centralized federal government through lobbying and money than it is for us to influence it with our vote, and that is why <i>every fucking thing that the federal government touches turns to shit</i>.  In that way, I think my ideals are far more realistic and plausible than yours.  I don&#39;t have any allusions of the very real fact that industry will always do whatever they possibly can do to make as much money as possible without ever considering the costs to the average person.  You assume that by giving more and more power to a centralized group of people, we can stop those companies from hurting people, whereas I believe those companies are so equipped to hurt people due to overwhelming power given to a more and more centralized group of people that are naturally easily influenced by the same fundamental human traits that make people want to make money in the first place.		</div>

						I&#39;m reading a lot about a provision in Section 102 of the current draft that would apparently outlaw private insurance.  Anybody heard/read something about this that isn&#39;t completely retarded?<br /><br />Here&#39;s the language that I&#39;m WAY too lazy to wade through this afternoon:<br />The offending section: America&#39;s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, Section 102.<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">SEC. 102. PROTECTING THE CHOICE TO KEEP CURRENT COVERAGE.<br /><br />(a) Grandfathered Health Insurance Coverage Defined- Subject to the succeeding provisions of this section, for purposes of establishing acceptable coverage under this division, the term &#96;grandfathered health insurance coverage&#39; means individual health insurance coverage that is offered and in force and effect before the first day of Y1 if the following conditions are met:<br /><br />(1) LIMITATION ON NEW ENROLLMENT-<br /><br />(A) IN GENERAL- <b>Except as provided in this paragraph, the individual health insurance issuer offering such coverage does not enroll any individual in such coverage if the first effective date of coverage is on or after the first day of Y1.</b><br /><br />(<img src="src" alt="image" />/cool.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid="B)" border="0" alt="cool.gif" /&gt; DEPENDENT COVERAGE PERMITTED- Subparagraph (A) shall not affect the subsequent enrollment of a dependent of an individual who is covered as of such first day.<br /><br />(2) LIMITATION ON CHANGES IN TERMS OR CONDITIONS- Subject to paragraph (3) and except as required by law, the issuer does not change any of its terms or conditions, including benefits and cost-sharing, from those in effect as of the day before the first day of Y1.<br /><br />(3) RESTRICTIONS ON PREMIUM INCREASES- The issuer cannot vary the percentage increase in the premium for a risk group of enrollees in specific grandfathered health insurance coverage without changing the premium for all enrollees in the same risk group at the same rate, as specified by the Commissioner.<br /><br />(<img src="src" alt="image" />/cool.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid="B)" border="0" alt="cool.gif" /&gt; Grace Period for Current Employment-based Health Plans-<br /><br />(1) GRACE PERIOD-<br /><br />(A) IN GENERAL- The Commissioner shall establish a grace period whereby, for plan years beginning after the end of the 5-year period beginning with Y1, an employment-based health plan in operation as of the day before the first day of Y1 must meet the same requirements as apply to a qualified health benefits plan under section 101, including the essential benefit package requirement under section 121.<br /><br />(<img src="src" alt="image" />/cool.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid="B)" border="0" alt="cool.gif" /&gt; EXCEPTION FOR LIMITED BENEFITS PLANS- Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an employment-based health plan in which the coverage consists only of one or more of the following:<br /><br />(i) Any coverage described in section 3001(a)(1)(<img src="src" alt="image" />/cool.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid="B)" border="0" alt="cool.gif" /&gt;(ii)(IV) of division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br /><br />(ii) Excepted benefits (as defined in section 733&copy; of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974), including coverage under a specified disease or illness policy described in paragraph (3)(A) of such section.<br /><br />(iii) Such other limited benefits as the Commissioner may specify.<br /><br />In no case shall an employment-based health plan in which the coverage consists only of one or more of the coverage or benefits described in clauses (i) through (iii) be treated as acceptable coverage under this division<br /><br />(2) TRANSITIONAL TREATMENT AS ACCEPTABLE COVERAGE- During the grace period specified in paragraph (1)(A), an employment-based health plan that is described in such paragraph shall be treated as acceptable coverage under this division.<br /><br />&copy; Limitation on Individual Health Insurance Coverage-<br /><br />(1) IN GENERAL- Individual health insurance coverage that is not grandfathered health insurance coverage under subsection (a) may only be offered on or after the first day of Y1 as an Exchange-participating health benefits plan.<br /><br />(2) SEPARATE, EXCEPTED COVERAGE PERMITTED- Excepted benefits (as defined in section 2791&copy; of the Public Health Service Act) are not included within the definition of health insurance coverage. Nothing in paragraph (1) shall prevent the offering, other than through the Health Insurance Exchange, of excepted benefits so long as it is offered and priced separately from health insurance coverage.</div><br /><br />I&#39;ve heard 2 arguments made:<br /><br />1. this means you won&#39;t be able to switch to any plan ever unless it&#39;s the government plan.<br />or<br />2. this passage specifically defines and limits &#39;grandfathered health insurance&#39; such that when new federal regulations are placed on private insurance companies, you get to keep your current insurance for as long as you like.  After Y1, all newly designed health coverage will have to abide by these regulations.<br /><br />#1 sounds like bullshit<br />#2 sounds like apologist bullshit		</div>

						It sounds to me like if you have an insurance plan before the effective date of the bill then you get to keep it and it counts as full health insurance.  However, if you have a grandfathered-in policy and decide you want to switch plans after the effective date of the bill, then you can either go with a government plan or go with a private plan that passes government muster (it MUST offer benefits the government tells it to offer).  Basically, if a private insurance company wants to write a new plan after the effective date of the bill then the plan must meet federal guidelines. <br /><br />My argument against that would be that what if you want certain benefits and not others and want to be able to pay less or more for them?  Their argument would be that the last section says you can get lesser benefit coverage but it will not count as full health care coverage.  My argument back is what if the government requires each individual to get full health care coverage and the plan they like is not defined as full health care coverage under the bill unless it offers all the benefits the federal government mandates that it offer.		</div>

						hm...<br /><br />That&#39;s kind of what I got out of it too, with a bunch of what ifs attached.  <br /><br />Do these &quot;mandates&quot; define what must and must not be covered?  I read bits and pieces of the draft and saw one thing that I&#39;d characterize as a mandate, and it was that there will be no such denials of coverage for pre-existing conditions, which I&#39;m totally cool with.<br /><br />It&#39;s completely valid to be concerned with the federal government getting involved in stuff, but all the things that the big scary government CAN do to us with our health care (deny coverage, charge penalties, dictate which doctors you can go to...) are things that health insurance companies in the private sector already do.<br /><br />One thing&#39;s for damned sure though, I have no idea what this bill will look like by the time it passes the president&#39;s desk.<br /><br />/questions and comments not directed at you in particular Eves.

						It especially stinks when you try and find it on your own and see the top 12 Google links all go to right wing blogs and fox...<br /><br />But the factoid that people who have insurance are *satisfied* with their insurance is largely irrelevant to the debate about health care reform.  So I thought I&#39;d let it slide.<br /><br />Particularly since I easily found stats saying stuff like 55% of Americans are dissatisfied with hospital wait times, or doctor choices, etc.  I don&#39;t buy those either, and those too are irrelevant to the debate on health care reform.		</div>

						Andrew, serious question.  Do you do any actual &quot;work&quot; at your job?  I don&#39;t disagree with most of what you&#39;ve said, I&#39;m just trying to figure out where you find the time to look all this shit up, and then post 15x a day in a relatively well spoken manner.  How much actual work, would you say...  You do during any given day?		</div>

How much actual work, would you say...  You do during any given day?</div><br /><br />This morning I got into work, fired up email, answered 2 questions and asked 4 more.  Then I set up a Thermal Vacuum RF Insertion Loss test and while waiting for the vacuum to pull down I went and ran a 10 minute DWV electrical test on the cables that came out of that chamber last night, then took them upstairs to the RF lab for further testing.  Then I had to wait an hour for the Thermal Vacuum test after it reaches pressure.  During this hour I posted and double checked some facts while reading Fark and Kotaku.<br /><br />Now I just ran the first measurement for that test and have to wait another 2 hours for it to reach temperature and then 1 hour to stabalize, then measure again.  During this time period, I plan on getting lunch, going upstairs to learn how to test Phase Stability in an hour or fail to do so and let them handle it in the RF lab for now.<br /><br />The rest of this afternoon will be spent running the second measurement, repairing the unused Vacuum chamber&#39;s liquid nitrogen valve, scheduling time in a thermal shock chamber, and writing a report.<br /><br />I have no idea how I find time to post 15x a day... actually.<br /><br />Fast fingers?		</div>

      <description><![CDATA[Hey all<br /><br />So I'm getting really into things now that I finally have SC2 and was wondering if any of you still played.<br />My in game name is Vachai feel free to add me to friends and hit me up if you wanna do some stuff. So far what I've gotten into is mostly 1v1 ladder style matches, I haven't even touched the custom games yet.  But I'd be down for whatever if any of you want to get together and do something.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[We&#39;re hosting the first &quot;official&quot; FD Starcraft 2 tournament this upcoming Wednesday:<br /><br />Sign up: -- full --<br />Date: 2011-01-05<br />Time: 7:30pm EST<br />Type: Double elimination, best of 1<br />Teams: 8<br /><br />All skill levels are welcome.  By referee decision, the favored side of hugely unbalanced match-ups in the winner bracket must play an off-race.<br /><br />Since we&#39;re trying to keep this to one night, the players will be strictly capped at 8.  Our last tournament was in the same format with 6 players, and it ended up lasting close to five hours.  To avoid that, multiple matches will be played at once, especially in the earlier rounds.<br /><br />Time permitting, the final match will be best of 3.  Participants and non-participants alike are free to observe any matches.<br /><br />For the sake of organizing the matches, the ongoing use of mumble throughout the night is required.  Contact me if you need details for this.<br /><br />The last tournament was a ton of fun for everyone involved, and some of the most fun was had while chatting on mumble and observing other games.  I hope we see some different faces this time as well&#33;]]></description>

Kurt and I were getting dominated early by the terran siege tech and zerg brood lords.  He transitioned into ultralisks, but the terran player went to battlecruisers.  I was sitting on one mined out base.  The ultras ended up taking down the other zerg player&#39;s base, and forced the terran player to float all his buildings.  It then had an additional 20 minutes of the terran trying to kill my floating bases, and me trying to kill the other terran&#39;s flying buildings.  Pretty crazy.  We won 44 points from this game.<br /><br />-dan]]></description>

There were a few times in the game that if he rushed it would&#39;ve been close. He also didn&#39;t scout my second expo till way later. As well my second expo was started at 3 min and his was started at 18 min so I had the upper hand there.<br /><br />Don&#39;t mind the last 5 minutes of the replay, I was just savouring the victory and killing off his shit for fun after he left.<br /><br />Any critiquing or comments are more than welcome.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33&amp;show=details&amp;id=152949" target="_blank">http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/repl...s&amp;id=152949</a>]]></description>

He got thors really fast, and I had to do everything I could to pump out some broodlords as quick as I could.  I was saved by his desire to kill my expansions before my main base.<br /><br />I think my biggest problem here was not upgrading.  I didn&#39;t upgrade my ground forces at all.

However, he kept sending in a few zerglings at a time, so with a queen, I was able to defend without too much effort.  I stopped him from expanding twice, and with my expansion already up, I overwhelmed him with zerglings and roaches.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33&amp;show=details&amp;id=151066" target="_blank">http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/repl...s&amp;id=151066</a>]]></description>

I believe KaP may also want some input&#33;<br /><br />Things I know that I messed up on:<br />-Did not thoroughly spread overlords all over the map - was afraid of supply blocking myself when pheonix&#39;s kept sniping them.<br />-Did not expand enough, as is more than evident at the end of the game. <br />-Built way too many corruptors late game<br />-Did not grow creep up to expansion areas<br /><br />Overall, I would say this is one of the best games I have played in terms of units. <br />We both mixed up our unit composition pretty regularly, I think it was a pretty interesting game. (it sure felt intense to play)<br /><br />Our APM/Unit control were even for most of the match.<br /><br />Anyway, enjoy&#33;]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Hey guys,<br /><br />This is from a zerg&#39;s perspective. Recently it has come to my attention that I have zero clue on how to infiltrate a walled in base. I absolutely love early game harass - in fact I love it so much it probably screws me over for the remainder of the game.<br /><br />My typical build for ladder is:<br />10/scout<br />14/pool<br />14/gas<br />16/overlord<br />queen<br />10 zerglings -&gt; harass<br /><br />This is where I encounter a walled in base and things start to go completely awry. (sure I could just 6 pool each game but where is the fun in that?)<br /><br />If I get into the base: cool - I win, destroy workers, kite &amp; profit.<br /><br />Last night against terran, he completely walled in and went for marines/marauders. I realized my zerglings had no chance - so I built banelings. By the time I had those and was at his base to try and break down the wall/harass, he had a tank or two and my army melted. I pulled away and sat near his nat expo watching for expansion. Then I expanded/fast tech&#39;d to mutalisks (as MM/Tank would destroy zerg t1/1.5 ground army). He moved out with tanks and took out my fast expo just as I was pumping my first mutas, had to let it die. I expanded elsewhere. So did he, I couldn&#39;t stop it.<br /><br />My question: Where do I go from here?<br /><br />I went for muta harass on mineral lines and hit the front with zerglings for a distraction, but I swear he had so many marines I was rendered useless.<br /><br />In the end I had my base/3 expansions (two just for gas). I still couldnt keep a muta army big enough to inflict any damage to him. He was riding off base/1 expo and was able to thwart all my attempts at entering. Eventually he had 8 tanks, a bajillion marines, and 3 Thors. <br /><br />I magic boxed the thors down but died to marines, and then he just walked around the map picking off my expos while I frantically built a pathetic army to try and take out his expo (as stopping his army was impossible at this point).<br /><br />My only thought is that maybe ultralisks/nydus canal would have worked but really..... it looked bleak and I was tapped for gas just trying to maintain any sort of map control.<br /><br />(Sorry I couldn&#39;t post replay, I am at work; if it is necessary I&#39;ll post it later but it is a seriously poor game and boring to watch)<br /><br /><br /><b>TL;DR - How do I beat someone that deliberately turtles and masses a huge army?</b><br />]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I always struggle against terran, and I didn&#39;t do great this game.  I decided before going into the game that I was going to focus on pumping out a lot of units very quickly, and I think I did just that.  He tried MMM, but I basically just overwhelmed him with zerglings, roaches, and hydras.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33&amp;show=details&amp;id=151084" target="_blank">http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/repl...s&amp;id=151084</a>]]></description>

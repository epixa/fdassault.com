      <description><![CDATA[The Saga of Headshoots Hall of the Damned.  Home of HolisticDetective, Adamantium Clad Champion of the Sacred Hall and Most Supreme Warriordwarf.<br /><br />TLDR Warning, for people who don&#39;t like reading.  Also, typical Dwarf Fortress warning.  This shit is... kind of difficult to understand sometimes.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://lparchive.org/LetsPlay/Headshoots/Update%2001/index.html" target="_blank">Behold&#33;</a><br /><br />/nobodies gonna fucking read this shit.  But I swear, it&#39;s worth it.  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://lparchive.org/LetsPlay/Headshoots/Update%2045/index.html" target="_blank">An excerpt from where things go a little... south</a><br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">The fragility of our current workforce brings to mind my second goal- attracting more migrants. Almost all of our mentally fit dwarves are champions who refuse to work, so we&#39;ll soon badly need more migrants. The primary obstacle to this goal is sitting in our depot right now:<br /><br />-picture depicting a group of dwarven merchants sitting in the trade depot-<br /><br />These merchants will bring back news of the terrible slaughter to the mountainhomes, and then we&#39;ll never get more migrants. They must die, and quick.  I briefly pondered how to do that with such limited dwarfpower, when I suddenly realized how simple it would be.<br /><br />-picture of lava pool sitting next to the trade depot.  Separated only by a thin wall of stone.<br /><br />It&#39;s now or never, I don&#39;t know how soon they&#39;ll leave. There&#39;s no floodgate, so I order Whitecloak to deploy  WEAPON  manually.  Miraculously he survives, and the merchants start dying. Nemo terrifies the heck out of me by randomly dashing by as a barrel explodes.<br /><br />-picture of said activity-<br /><br />Fortunately he&#39;s perfectly fine. He says he was only filling his waterskin, but I think he was just being dramatic...<br />My relief is short lived, as everything begins to go horribly, horribly wrong at this point.  Three of the merchant guards made it out alive. They&#39;ll surely tell the tale of what transpired here today... I&#39;d be more disappointed if I hadn&#39;t already despaired by word that the mountainhomes already knew...<br /><img src="http://i53.tinypic.com/wlaa11.png" class="linked-image" alt="image" style="border: 0px;" /></div><br /><br />At this point lava started random leaking all over the fortress and he had to wall off half of the fortress, sealing himself and some other sane and uninjured dwarves off from the ensuing madness and death in what they now refer to as West Headshoots.<br /><img src="http://i52.tinypic.com/3090oe0.png" class="linked-image" alt="image" style="border: 0px;" /><br />oh... West Headshoots...<br /><br />Don&#39;t tell me that shit isn&#39;t fucking hilarious.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I was kicking back and relaxing, watching some tv. Police pull up in the driveway. I go outside to see what the problem is. And before I can really say anything the problem becomes obvious. Horses, three of them. Also a pony and a mule. Wandering through the yard. They are trying to keep them from wandering into the road or onto the Highway (they built (not 100% complete) a Highway practically next door.).<br /><br />     After a bit of conversation with the officer I discover they have gotten loose from a neighbor. About a mile and a half or two miles through the woods. Let the rodeo begin. Another officer goes to the mobile home across the creek and sounds siren to move the horses back in our general direction. Does not go quite to plan, about 90 degree tangent to desired direction. Thus I became a cowboy and start herding them back towards home. <br /><br />     There is an old logging road below my house (between the house and highway) that heads in the general direction of the farm the animals escaped from. The officer on my side helps me get them headed towards it. I offer to get my truck and &quot;push&quot; them down the road as far as it is accessible. Get my truck and head out to the logging road. Before I get down the road a guy pulls up. He has been called by the police and informed of the horses whereabouts. I tell him I am about to head down the road and push them towards the farm. He says he is going to go and get some bridles for the horses. I say ok and that I will meet him where the road/horses stop. I am able to make it about 3/4 of a mile down the logging road (impressed with my truck, didn&#39;t originally purchase it for off-roading). About 40 minutes or so later I am wondering where this guy is. Guess he had no idea where the road went. <br /><br />     So begins the fun. I start herding the horses in the general direction of &quot;home&quot;, assuming they know where they are going. Direction of travel is confirmed by the signs of their earlier travel towards my house. Quite sometime later we arrive at the fenceline of the farm. I yell a bit. No response. So I get out the trusty cell phone and call the police and ask them to try and contact the owner. The make contact with him apparently. The owner calls me and tells me he is driving towards the entrance to the logging road, this confused me because I had clearly told the operator at the station that I was at HIS property. It took him a bit to understand that I had herded them to his property and he needed to come back. In case you are wondering why I didn&#39;t just take them to the nearest gate was because I had no idea how much further it was to said gate and I was hot and irritated. Herding the horses,pony, and mule was entertaining what with the terrain, creek, and previously logged area we traveled through. Was also pissed when I saw the incomplete job of fencing that had been done in the area I assume the horses got out from. <br /><br />     Well the horses made it home ok and I got a nice walk through the woods, creek, logged out area and everyone ended up happy, well except for the horses I imagine. <br /><br />     What I learned was that horses in general are O.K., ponies like to stand around confused by things, and Mules really are stubborn.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Man is this fucked up.  Seems to be kind of typical of some of the people living around here.  Worth the read though.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">Before you read this: Please don’t judge me… I’m just sharing my story because people asked… <br /><br />Wow… okay, I wasn’t sure if I was ever going to tell anyone about this, but it’s late and I’m sleep deprived so i guess I’ll just write it now and regret it in the morning :/ <br /><br />First of all, - just for some background: My mom died right when I was born, (she was actually really, really hot- but this isn’t about her. I guess that’s fucked up to say, but whatever.) I actually grew up with my dad’s family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up. <br /><br />Anyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie. <br /><br />I don’t want to go into to many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn’t make it for me- but I thought she was so damned beautiful that I watched it twice. I probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home. (My dad’s family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it). <br /><br />Sooo… I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when I left home. <br /><br />My friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to fuck her brains out. Looking back on it now, it’s pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too. She actually kissed me right after we came to get her… and it wasn’t a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn’t like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn’t sisterly. <br /><br />After we left, we all went to crash with my Sister’s friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous. He’s a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging. <br /><br />Pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I’m not saying that I’m proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time. <br /><br />My friend and my sister never hooked up I don’t think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident. It was fucked up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips. <br /><br />Sadly (although, I guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. We spent some time apart… and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way. It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her. But I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I’ve ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. Sigh. <br /><br />A little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). I can’t say I was surprised. <br /><br />But even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party… my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone. It was a really intimate moment. I think something might have happened, except that I killed the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him.</div><br />]]></description>

Nothing else.  The motion in the pistons is induced by the generation and shedding of vorteces in the water due to cylinders placed perpendicular to the flow.<br /><br />The power density of the system is only slightly lower than that of a coal plant, and a farm of these structures placed in an analogous environment performs with nearly 15,000 times the power density.<br /><br />Unlike underwater turbines, these structures are passive and safe for marine wildlife.  They are also highly scalable, since you are not required to use a minimum length/width/etc.  To achieve oscillation, you need only get within a 60% harmonic environment, which leaves HUGE tolerances in the components.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.rexresearch.com/bernitsas/bernitsas.htm" target="_blank">Serious shit.</a>]]></description>

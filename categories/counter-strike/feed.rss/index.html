      <description><![CDATA[Hey guys I used to play on the 24'7 Assault servers way back in the day with FD I was wondering if there were still any of the original members still around or if this is even the same forbidden donut and if you all are still running a server?<br /><br />I remember gachi and budwiser and many others. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Anyone playing it? <br /><br />I made it about twice as long as when I played source, about 45 minutes.  It seemed hard as fuck to see anything.  Recently I saw this (watch the whole thing)<br /><br /><div class="Video"><object width="400" height="225"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/mXyH0_JqxbI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/mXyH0_JqxbI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="400" height="225"></embed></object></div><br /><br />It seems alright other than that.  IMO molotovs are a cool addition.  AWP is annoying; the time between when you stop moving and can shoot straight is a lot longer than in 1.6.  Deagle is overpowered like css; you can even shoot accurately with it on ladders.  <br /><br />Any opinions on it?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I logged on steam today and my main gain is counter-strike the updated news about the game was this one<br /><br /><br />A Counter-Strike player in France has spent six months plotting a revenge attack against a man who beat him in an in-game knife fight. His eventual revenge was not in-game.<br /><br />20 year-old Julien Barreaux, from Cambrai, had his Counter-Strike character &quot;knifed&quot; in a game late last year against another man, known only as &quot;Mikhael&quot;. Enraged at this blight against his talents, Barreaux spent six months tracking him down in the real world.<br /><br />When he eventually found the victim, Barreaux knocked on the guy&#39;s front door, then &quot;plunged a kitchen knife into his chest&quot; when Mikhael opened it to greet him. He missed his heart by an inch.<br /><br />A local police officer told the courts &quot;Barreaux was arrested within the hour and told us he had wanted to see his rival wiped out for killing off his character.&quot;<br /><br />The judge, who locked him up for two years on a charge of causing grievous bodily harm, says of Barreaux, &quot;You are a menace to society. I am frankly terrified of the disproportionate reaction you could have if someone looked at you the wrong way in the street.&quot;<br /><br />SOURCE: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://kotaku.com/5550609/man-spends-six-months-plotting-murder-of-counter+strike-rival" target="_blank">http://kotaku.com/5550609/man-spends-six-m...er+strike-rival</a>]]></description>

So it comes to the bottom line:<br /><br />Do we want to continue this? <br /><br />If so, then we need stronger actions towards keeping the server populated, and we cannot continue to expect Gammanco to keep furnishing this server. I havent seen a single donation since this started. Pass the collection plate&#33;<br /><br />What are your thoughts on this as a community.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I&#39;ve recently gotten back into playing cs every once in a while and was curious to see how many people would be interested in pugging.  This wouldn&#39;t be a team, just seeing if it would be realistic to find a group of people to do scrims with.  <br /><br />The plan would be to have a group of friends where we could develop at least a working knowledge of playing together, and potentially have more fun than would happen in a typical pug where the only coordination that occurs is &#39;okay 3-2 A guys&#39; or &#39;rush B&#39;.  <br /><br />That being said, I don&#39;t really care what your skill level is, and I want this to be open to everyone, and be fairly laid back.  I just ask that you be willing to make an effort to play as a team, communicate, listen to calls, and have fun.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I know that a lot of you guys gave up on cs but some of us didn&#39;t and a little group of us decided to take an other shot a cal.<br /><br />We are serious about it we were practicing 3-4 days per week when the seasons started, but now we decided to stop practicing because cal has been down since 1-2 weeks and until cal resume their operations its worthless to practice that and the fact that we are probably gonna cut 2 members which left us with only 4 active members<br /><br />Team page : <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.caleague.com/?page=teams&amp;teamid=197997" target="_blank">http://www.caleague.com/?page=teams&amp;teamid=197997</a><br /><br />The 4 most active members left are :<br /><br />LethaL<br />Skillz<br />Ebola<br />Scabdates<br /><br />other members are :<br /><br />Jono<br />CJ<br />HighRoller<br /><br />The goal of this post is to see if any of you would be interested in helping us out because when cal restart we will probably need 1-2 more which can be active and practice, we might cut down on practice time though<br /><br />If you are interested just post in this thread, contact me, skillz or ebola, we try to accommodate practices with schedules so don&#39;t be afraid to let us know you are interested]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I was playing tonight in a server where 75% were enjoying just doing some stacks and other team strategy stuff. A couple people kept ruining it by shooting and pretending they were Gamms so I told everyone that wanted to have some fun to come to the server. <br /><br />It was empty at the time, but within minutes, the server was up to about 12 people. Blacklight and Malisk even joined in on the fun.<br /><br />Attached are some screen shots. Enjoy&#33;<br /><br />-ish<br /><br />And my apologies for only knowing how to add attachments and not knowing how to add thumbnailed images.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[So i have a shaman with top end gear that i&#39;ve played for a while.  I am looking to sell it for a fair price because there is no fucking chance i&#39;m doing chain heal spam come expansion.<br /><br />Here is the deal: It is currently on an account with 4 level 70s (STFU, CS had big shoes to fill, and i wasn&#39;t in school).  I would like to transfer it to a brand new account and then sell the new account, thus keeping the other 3.<br /><br />I am wondering if anyone has any experience in this matter and would know the best way to go about selling it.  As in, websites, forums, how to not get banned in doing so.  My research isn&#39;t panning out nicely and i have yet to find a reputable source to attempt a sale through.  Anything you can say about the matter would be appreciated.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Zul’Aman<br /><br />Zul&#39;Aman is a 10-player, level 70 outdoor instance located in the Ghostlands. Players will be able to confront six new bosses including the Forest Troll Warlord Zul&#39;jin.<br /><br />Guild Banks Introduced<br /><br />The Guild Bank is a shared repository for an entire guild and will be accessible through new NPC’s called guild bankers. The Guild Bank will allow players with the appropriate permissions to store items and money for use by the rest of the guild. Permissions to withdraw and deposit money and items are controlled by the guild leader through the guild controls menu. The Guild Bank is divided up into separate tabs so that the guild leader may restrict access or group items into distinct categories.<br />• Up to 6 purchasable tabs each containing 98 item slots.<br />• Permissions to view/deposit/withdraw per tab.<br />• You may use your Guild Bank withdraw limits to pay for item repairs (now enabled on all merchants).<br />• Transaction logs of the last 50 actions in the bank viewable on a per tab basis.<br /><br />General<br />• Zul’Aman<br />• Guild Banks<br />• Experience: The amount of experience needed to gain a level has been decreased between levels 20 and 60. In addition, the amount of experience granted by quests has been increased between levels 30 and 60.<br />• Expertise: We have added a new stat and associated rating called expertise and expertise rating. Expertise rating converts to expertise at the same rate that weapon skill rating formerly converted at. Each point of expertise reduces the chance for your attacks to be dodged or parried by 0.25%.<br />• Healing reduction effects will now affect all health drain spells and abilities (e.g. Mortal Strike will reduce health gained from Drain Life).<br />• Healing: Almost all items and enchantments that provide bonus healing now also provide a smaller number (approximately 1/3) of bonus spell damage. There are a few items and enchantments where this was not possible, such as random-stat items and Zul&#39;Gurub enchantments, but this is now the case on virtually all other items.<br />• On Kill Effects: Items and abilities that trigger on killing an enemy will no longer trigger on using an ability that kills your pet.<br />• Weapon Skill: All items and abilities that granted weapon skill have been changed. In most cases, they were converted to expertise or expertise rating. Ranged attacks do not benefit from expertise, so ranged weapon skill has generally been replaced by critical strike bonuses or hit bonuses. In a few cases, talents have been changed to other effects to avoid granting players excessive amounts of expertise.<br />• A new flight path has been added to the Rebel Camp in northern Stranglethorn Vale.<br />• Flying units can see ground units and vice versa at any altitude.<br />• Players no longer gain the moving AOE radius bonus if they are jumping.<br />• Client spell cast requests are now sent to the server even if your player is already casting another spell.

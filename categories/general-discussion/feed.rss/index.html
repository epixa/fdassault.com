      <description><![CDATA[As some of you have already noticed, I restarted the fantasy football league from last year and invited all those who were in the league in 2011 to join via whatever Yahoo! account they used last year. If you didn't get an invite, the info is:<br /><br />League ID: 278431<br />Password: govisshort<br /><br />This is regularly one of the more competitive leagues I'm in, and it'd be great if we could get as good of a turnout this year (the 5th year! can't believe it's been this long) as we did last year. I know it may seem futile going up against both the 2011 and the 2009 champeen, but I welcome the challenge.<br /><br />I am also welcome to rule changes or anything else to mix things up - I have considered auction but getting everyone for the draft is always a problem, but would consider FAAB (I actually don't know if you can do this with a normal draft) as well as instituting PPR, more flex positions, two QBs, etc. Please post your thoughts here.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Maintaining this forum is becoming a pain point for me.  I don't mind the costs, but there are more and more spammers signing up each day (200 or so in the past 24 hours), and if I ignore them they will essentially make the forums unusable.<br /><br />A long while ago I created the empty r/fdassault on reddit, and I'm thinking about boarding up these forums for good and redirecting all traffic there.  All forum contents would be archived in a read-only state (browsable on the web and downloadable) and linked to from the subreddit sidebar.<br /><br />Does anyone have any objections to this?<br /><br />Edit: Also, is anyone interested in helping to moderate on the subreddit?  There will still be spam coming through on occasion, and some legit posts my get hung up in the spam filters as well.  I figure the more moderators the better.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Dunno if anyone plays RPGs, but this one looks pretty good. I've been participating in the beta weekends. It comes out 8/28, costs $60 (although you can get it for $48 on newegg and some other places with a coupon) has no subscription. Its got some better assumptions about time investment and incentive structures than most of the rest of the mmorpg market. The PvP might even be decent (GW1 was). If you are bitter towards WoW/Rift/SWToR, this might be a better game for you! <br /><br />I'll post my server choice once the release is imminent. If anyone is participating in the July 20-22 beta test weekend add me : Bootsy.3157 ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I know not many people read these forums anymore, but for those who do, feel free to offer some insight.<br /><br />Here's a general run down of where I am...<br /><br />Currently hold an associates degree in Criminal Justice from 2006. (Wanted to become a police officer, but due to vision requirements, it's not something possible for me at this time)<br /><br />Finished up four years in the Marine Corps recently. The job I had there as a radio operator doesn't translate to well to the civilian sector.<br /><br />I'm thinking about going back to school but really can't decide on what to do... Try to become a lawyer? a doctor? something in Computer Science? I have a family and am dreading doing any full time school while doing full time work (did this for my associates and it sucked, but I had no children back then). I'd like a school that's closer to me here in California, unfortunately, the one school offering Comp Sci is about 50 minutes away (Cal State). Then there's JFK University close by, but they don't offer Comp Sci. They do have a law school though.<br /><br />decisions...decisions.<br /><br />Quite frankly, in the end, I'd like to have a solid job that pays me well for what I do. I've worked many years of retail sales and it's not something I enjoy doing and definitely not something I can make a decent living off of. I really just want to scream right now, lol.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Long story short, i moved out of my last apartment in November, and stored my computer away until now.  In spite, my old roommate decided it would be HILARIOUS if she changed the password to log into the thing.  <br /><br />I&#39;ve spoken with her many times and sadly she has forgotten what the password was changed to.<br /><br />The specifics: <br />Using windows 7, 64x<br />No, i stupidly did not create an admin login<br />No, i stupidly did not create a password recovery disk<br />No, there are not other users of the computer<br />- The scenario is this: Power up computer, let windows load, it then shows my name (Ben) and prompts me to enter the password.  This is the part where I am stuck.  In a cruel twist, she even changed the hint to: R U Mad?<br /><br />Yes, i am fucking mad.<br /><br />I&#39;ve searched the internet a bit and have found many sites that claim their software can easily bypass it to allow me to again reset it.  I&#39;ve gone as far as emailing one of the companies asking for further information, and 7 days later, i&#39;ve heard nothing.  This would cost about &#36;20.  I&#39;ve also read that Windows can remotely reset it for &#36;80, but have conflicting reports saying that Windows will do no such thing.<br /><br />I&#39;ve found a site that seems to be free (albeit it hasn&#39;t been updated in over a year) but when I went to put the files on a flash drive and boot my computer from that drive, it informs me that no opperating system is found, which is probably something I&#39;m doing wrong.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would like to avoid reformatting as losing 80 gigs of music would be devastating.  I will if I have to, but a portion of my soul will be wiped clean, similarly as the hard drive.<br /><br />Any help in this issue would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[So this weekend I just got done building my i7 setup.  After a few days of running I downloaded Prime 95 to stress test and Core Temp to monitor temps.  I was a little surprised to see I was idling around 40 and under load hitting high 70&#39;s.  So I figured I may have screwed up the thermal paste.  Redid it, and low and behold idling 40&#39;s... but under load was rising way too fast towards 100.  So I knew I screwed something up... well I did it one more time.  <br /><br />Idles around 34, and load 66.  Phew lol.  Not sure what I screwed up both times but good to have it running the way it should be.  After the thermal paste cures I&#39;ll look into overclocking it in a couple weeks.]]></description>

I tried setting the ip address to the wireless card on the laptop manually to 192.168.1.101 since the computer is .100, yet the same thing happened when i tried again (how does that even make sense?).  <br /><br />i looked through the settings but couldn&#39;t find anywhere to specify different ip ranges between wired and wireless--which i suppose makes sense because the router should know not to assign the same ip to the only two computers on the network lol<br /><br />Has anyone had this trouble before or have insights into how to resolve the problem?

I woke up to see my laptop off, so I hit the power button only to have it say there was no bootable disk.<br /><br />I plugged in the flash drive I installed linux from, reinstalled grub (linux boot manager), and booted into Windows only to have everything that was running last night be open, so it must have went to sleep.  Why would sleep corrupt the boot manager?  Or did it not corrupt it, but then what would cause grub not to load when powering the laptop on?  This seems very strange.<br /><br /><br />edit: lol windors<br /><br /><b>edit:  it was hibernation, not sleep.  sleep works ok.</b>]]></description>

Hands down, the best keyboards I&#39;ve ever owned have been MAC keyboards, but that isn&#39;t really an option for a PC.  That being said, I would very much like to get a similar low-profile keyboard that can handle many buttons being held down at a time.  I would _love_ it if the keyboard had USB slots like the MAC keyboards have as well.  Beyond that, volume control, play/stop/forward/backward keys would be a bonus, but I could certainly live without them.<br /><br />Does anyone have an idea as to where I should look for this?  I&#39;ve glanced through Amazon briefly, and I was surprised to see how terrible the keyboards were there.]]></description>

And that installation is easy and safe to your files?<br /><br />Bullshit.<br /><br />Ran bootcamp, partitioned the disc space.<br /><br />Inserted XP disc when prompted.<br /><br />Windows install begins, I format the partition using NTFS (The ONLY option available).<br /><br />The system now continues to restart, and prompts for a new XP install each time.  Repairing nets the same results.  I do the mac bullshit and when its in its restart (not during any writing of files) and eject the disc by holding the mouse key.<br /><br />Now I get an error with simply a picture of a file folder with a question mark in it, which is SO useful.  Thankfully, google on my other windows machine tells me that the error picture I see means the computer cannot find a system folder.  A little odd since I only touched the windows partition.  Google also tells me that I should have created a mac drivers disc for windows.  Another thing bootcamp didn&#39;t mention at all.<br /><br />Oh and, what&#39;s this?  Google also tells me that I was supposed to install using FAT 32... which I did not have the option for.<br /><br />No biggy.  I&#39;ll restart with the boot disc and reinstall OS X.  Oh wait, when I get to the install, and it tells me to select where I would like to install the OS there are NO AVAILABLE OPTIONS.<br /><br />The disc utility shows me that I have my partition, as well as the rest of the drive.  It shows the rest of the drive as being OSX compatible.  It also won&#39;t let me re-format or do anything similar to said drive, or do anything AT ALL to the drive because it is &quot;read only&quot;.<br /><br />So now my only option is to boot using my windows install as my boot drive, which only boots if I have the windows install disc inserted, and then only boots to the windows XP install screen AGAIN.<br /><br /><span>FUCK MAC.</span><br /><br />If anyone has any ideas, aside from taking it back and saying &quot;It doesn&#39;t fucking work.&quot; PLEASE, hook a brotha up.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Just finished bootcamp.  I&#39;m now down in Pensacola, FL.  I&#39;ll tell you guys more about it after I have my own laptop and internet connection.  I&#39;ve got a 30 min limit here.  <br /><br />I need links/suggestions for a laptop around &#36;750.  I&#39;m looking for value and reliability.  Gaming isn&#39;t a priority for me anymore, though I will definitely still be doing it.  Any help is welcome.  I&#39;ll be back tomorrow to check this so help fast&#33;  I&#39;d like to buy it this week.  Worse comes to worse, I may have to just stop in at Best Buy and pick one up there.  But can&#39;t I find better deals online?<br /><br />Thanks guys&#33;]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[What I know so far (just got it)<br /><br />4 each Western Digital velociraptor hd&#39;s WD3000GLFS<br /><br />Intel Q6600 quad core<br /><br />Gigabyte mobo. Not sure of exact model yet.<br /><br />Kingwin 700 watt power supply<br /><br />Unknown ATI video card<br /><br />Currently running windows server 2003 with unknown passwords so I cannot do anything yet. Trying an Ubuntu install RAID 0. Just for giggles.<br /><br />Overall cost to me     ZERO DOLLARS&#33;&#33;&#33; <br /><br />Seemed like a good deal to me. Hopefully I don&#39;t mess things up with the linux install. What is the latest on Windows 7? anyone  with real world experience? How about a RAID install, will it support it?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Anyone know of a good sound editing program that&#39;s free? I&#39;m not looking for anything too fancy, but would like to be able to edit (splice, spped up, slow down, etc) audio files I alreayd have. The only stuff I&#39;ve found have been trial versions that insert the name of the software every 30 seconds upon saving the file -- would like to avoid that.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[So i thought this lag spike that I had every moment was because I lived in my old apartment.  My roommate recently made a change to his DGL - 4300 two weeks ago.  Everything was fine for two weeks but within the last week, the huge lag spikes returned and I have no idea what the fuck is going wrong with it.  This is what I&#39;ve done so far (I know all of you are CS related so I hope you can help, I&#39;ve posted in the gOf forums but I figure I&#39;ll try to reach out my resources).<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">I get massive lag spikes every moment or so and I know I&#39;m lagging because I can feel it in CS and in vent I spike up to 5000 - 25000... I know it&#39;s the router because my old router a Linksys never did this to me and the moment my roommate changed it to his D-Link DGL-4300 I started having these spiking issues (I had these before but i&#39;m too lazy to look it up...)<br /><br />So is there anything I can do to fix this annoying problem? Because I can&#39;t have conversations in vent and I can&#39;t play in any games...<br /><br />I recently made my change from XP to Windows 7 in hopes that would solve the problem but nope, it didn&#39;t...so any thoughts? HALP&#33;</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE </div><div class="quotemain">so...let&#39;s see...<br /><br />Tried to do the whole port forwarding by using the site portforwarding.com<br /><br />I created a static IP address, figured out my primary and secondary DNS go my MAC address and all and made sure that I created ports for Ventrillo and counterstrike...yet I&#39;m still spiking to 15000 on ventrillo...<br /><br />I&#39;m pretty much lost at this point. When I create a static IP it doesn&#39;t work, when I&#39;m using dynamic IP it doesn&#39;t work...go me?<br /><br />Edit: 9:55pm<br /><br />Changed it back to dynamic IP, portforwarded everything to my IP on the router...still nothing. ARG&#33;</div><br /><br /><br />Any enlightenment? I am so confused right now lol...]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I have an about 2.5 year old Compaq laptop that I want to reinstall Windows on.  My question/problem is that I don&#39;t have any of the drivers etc to go with it.  I just have a windows xp disk that I would use to reinstall windows.  Will the wireless networking, or networking in general still be able to work?  I know with my desktop I have to install the motherboard drivers, graphics drivers, etc, for any of that to kick in.  Are these things I can just download off the internet if need be, or for some strange reason because its a Compaq they wouldn&#39;t be available?  Thanks for any/all help.]]></description>

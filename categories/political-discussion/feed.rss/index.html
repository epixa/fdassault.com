      <description><![CDATA[20 percent of polls have been counted and the true numbers will be out tomorrow. I hope our plea is answered and this 80 year discrimination is righted. I&#39;m sick of having to stress out about drug tests just to get a job. I was afraid of being busted earlier in my life, because in many states they&#39;ll withhold grants for receiving a possession ticket. Cops treat you with utter disrespect. Even though California is self-dependent I hate the idea of having to go through a black market to get something that science cannot decide if its a harmful intoxicant or medicinal wonder. Also, these last 100 years have been pretty much the only time in our species history where we have outlawed marijuana. <br /><br />Its absolutely stupid that us Stoners are more than happy to throw 2+ billion dollars into our struggling Californian Economy and there are people here who are so close minded to other peoples wants and interests so they chose to pass on it. I&#39;m still going to get high, legal or not, and anyone who voted no can go fuck themselves because all I wanted out of this was acceptance.]]></description>

      <title>Question; eventually relates to gay marriage</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Question:  Do you think the government has any role in promoting fundamental values?<br /><br />For example, should the government promote an entrepreneurial spirit as an important value or should it just create a chance for equal opportunities so that if society considers it important then it will thrive?  (By creating equal access the implicit value is that each person can pursue their happiness, but it is not explicit/a requirement to follow).<br /><br />I ask this because I think it has changed my opinion on gay marriage.  My original position was that gay couples should be given equal rights to married couples (in terms of benefits and having civil unions), but that they shouldn&#39;t be able have a state-sanctioned &quot;marriage.&quot;  My rationale was that government should be able to promote traditional marriage and the nuclear family as the fundamental building blocks of society.  But wouldn&#39;t our Founders have trusted religion/society/culture to continue viewing traditional marriage as special instead of having our government treat it as special?<br /><br />If the government is giving equal rights to gay couples except for the word &quot;marriage&quot; then the only purpose seems to be to promote traditional marriage.  [In the past the government actually gave married couples more rights than gay couples and so it was actually doing something rather than just promoting an idea, even though I am not advocating going back to that].<br /><br />It would be a totally different story if gay rights activists were trying to get religions to endorse their marriages, though.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Everything I, you, or anyone else could have to say about the debate is being said <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fark.com/cgi/comments.pl?IDLink=4382914" target="_blank">here</a> today.<br /><br />That said, I really don&#39;t know what to think about health care reform.<br /><br />We need it.  Badly.  In a lot of ways and on a lot of fronts.  But I reaaaaallly hate insurance companies, and if the plan to accomplish UHC involves them making more money (which it almost definitely will) I can&#39;t help but be a little more hesitant.]]></description>

How&#39;s that feel?  Oh, and good luck running for anything in the future if you don&#39;t slob on the corporate knob.  The Supreme Court of the United States, comprised of - theoretically - some of the wisest individuals on earth, has decided to bankrupt the country.  Both fiscally and morally.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Andrew must be on vacation...<br /><br />What are yalls thoughts on the speech?<br /><br />I personally didn&#39;t think it was too bad.  He did a good job of accepting some responsibility, as well as yelling at both parties and Congress in general.  I didn&#39;t agree with everything he said, but then I don&#39;t think he really said a whole lot that was inflammatory.  I wish he had touched on the NASA issue.  I&#39;m also not real big on the gays in the military portion of his speech.]]></description>

Maybe, &quot;We weren&#39;t greeted as liberators.&quot;  or &quot;I thought you said there would be no nation building...&quot;<br /><br />You might have better luck with things like &quot;where are the WMD&#39;s?&quot; or &quot;Didn&#39;t we call this torture as little as 10 years ago?&quot;<br /><br />And then we can all have a nice two-minutes hate about the Left-Wing media machine run by George Soros and Weather Underground.<br /><br />Why?  <br /><br />Because this is the internet, dammit.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[This is a direct indication of what wall street thinks of Obama. Raising capital gains taxes means either holding everything until Obama is out, or getting out before taxes increase.<br /><br />My personal estimates was that we are going down to 7500 before we level out.

      <description><![CDATA[And it says this:<br /><br />&quot;Last night, President Obama laid out his plan to defend our national interest by refocusing our efforts on three clear goals: defeating al Qaeda, stabilizing Pakistan, and breaking the Taliban&#39;s momentum in Afghanistan.<br /><br />To achieve these goals, the President has authorized the rapid deployment of 30,000 more troops in Afghanistan, with a firm commitment to begin bringing our troops home in 2011.<br /><br />It&#39;s a clean break from the failed Afghanistan policy of the Bush administration, and a new, focused strategy that can succeed.<br />&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />I fail to understand how putting troops into the middle east is any different that what Bush did, but sure, go ahead and tell us that you&#39;re going to take them out right around the time when you need to get elected again.]]></description>
